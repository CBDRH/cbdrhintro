<div id="section-what-is-r" class="section level2">
<h2>What is R?</h2>
<p>R is a high-level, open-source programming language.</p>
<p>‘High-level’ means that the language abstracts away (hides) many of the arcane and messy details of writing program code to run on a computer.</p>
<p>This allows a programmer to concentrate on the task rather than on the characteristics of computer on which it will run.</p>
<p>It also means that such high-level program code tends to be highly portable. Code written on one type of computer, say, under macOS, will run unchanged (or almost unchanged) on, say, a Windows- or Linux-based computer.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-the-origins-of-r" class="section level2">
<h2>The origins of R</h2>
<p>The origins of R lie in a language called S, which was developed by the AT&amp;T telecommunications company (formerly the Bell Telephone Company) in the US in the late 1970s and early 1980s, to speed up statistical analysis of telephone call and customer data.</p>
<p>The S language became a commercial software product called S/Plus, which rapidly became the language of choice for many statisticians, particularly those developing new statistical methods.</p>
<p>In the early 1990s, two statisticians at the University of Auckland in New Zealand, Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman, decided to create an alternative to the S language, which was closely modelled on it, but which could be freely used on computers in their university without having to pay license fees.</p>
<p>They named this language R (after their shared first initial, and as a pun on the name ‘S’).</p>
<p>Over the course of the 1990s and 2000s, R rapidly became very popular with statisticians, particularly those who were already using S or S/Plus, and eventually came to be arguably the dominant programming language for statistics and statistical graphics, and one of the most popular programming languages for data science, currently second only to Python.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-free-open-source-software" class="section level2">
<h2>Free, open-source software</h2>
<p>Open-source software is software that is made available under a licence that allows others to use and/or modify the software code.</p>
<p>Although this sounds like a recipe for chaos and anarchy, in practice it works very well and open-source software is now very widely used almost everywhere, including in mission-critical areas. Indeed, much of the internet runs on computers running the Linux operating system: Linux is open-source software.</p>
<p>The free, open-source licensing for both R and Python means that anyone can install them on as many computers as they wish without having to pay any licensing fees.</p>
<p>This is a tremendous advantage: it means that skills in Python and R are highly portable between jobs or projects, because the software on which those skills have been acquired can be installed anywhere.</p>
<p>It also facilitates the use of Python and R with ‘big data’, which may require the use of many computers simultaneously, all running the same program code on different parts of the data in parallel.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-software-ecosystems" class="section level2">
<h2>Software ecosystems</h2>
<p>The open-source licensing of both Python and R also means that anyone can modify or add to these software environments.</p>
<p>This has resulted in the growth of very large software ecosystems for both Python and R, in which (literally) tens of thousands of people have contributed extensions, add-in-packages and improvements for both languages.</p>
<p>For R, there is a large curated repository of such contributed code, called <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/">CRAN</a> <em>(The Comprehensive R Archive Network)</em>, containing over 11,000 contributed packages, and growing rapidly.</p>
<p>So, in summary, R is a fully-featured, ‘industrial-strength’ programming language which is mature and highly trusted, and is very suitable for most data science and data analysis tasks.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-which-is-better---r-or-some-other-language-like-python" class="section level2">
<h2>Which is better - R or some other language like Python?</h2>
<p>Neither. Choosing to concentrate on a single language for all things would be a mistake. While all modern computing languages are computationally equivalent (they can ultimately perform the same calculations) individually they have strength and weaknesses and certain things may be easier in one language or another.</p>
<p>It can be argued that R has better support for both traditional and cutting-edge statistical analyses, but R has excellent support for many sub-disciplines like machine learning, geospatial data manipulation, graph data support among others.</p>
<p>As a result, many data scientists are now using R as part of their toolkit, leveraging the particular strengths of the language where and when needed.</p>
<p>R includes excellent features for working with other languages. For example, there is a very efficient data interchange format (<a href="https://github.com/wesm/feather"><em>feather</em></a>), which allows the combination of R and Python code in a single project. It is even possible to <em>embed</em> a Python interpreter in R using the <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/index.html"><em>reticulate</em></a> package, and an R interpreter in Python using the <a href="https://rpy2.bitbucket.io"><em>RPy2</em></a> package, allowing you to use both languages at once, sharing data in-memory.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-a-not-so-quick-introduction-to-programming-in-r" class="section level2">
<h2>A (not-so) quick introduction to programming in R</h2>
<p>This tutorial provides a quick introduction to programming in the R language. It is not intended as a comprehensive treatise on the R language, but rather as an introduction to give an idea of what it is like to write programs in R.</p>
<p>R requires you to write code to get most things done. There are no point-and-click interfaces that will do everything that you need to do: writing code is inescapable.</p>
<p>But that’s a <strong>Good Thing™</strong>, because actions performed through code are repeatable and reproducible actions, and the code coupled with a good source control system automatically provides an audit trail of how data has been manipulated and the process of arriving at the final analysis.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-names-objects-and-the-assignment-operator-in-r" class="section level2">
<h2>Names, objects and the assignment operator in R</h2>
<p>First up, assignment.</p>
<p>R uses the compound symbol <code>&lt;-</code> to associate a value with a name.</p>
<p>Python and many other languages use <code>=</code> for this purpose, and a single equals sign also works for assignment in R too, but by convention, <code>&lt;-</code> is used instead.</p>
<p>In R, just referring to the name of an object by itself on a line is equivalent to printing out its value on the screen or console or output device, that is, the same as using the <code>print()</code> function.</p>
<p>In the code box below, assign the value <code>2</code> to an object named <code>a</code>, and examine the value of <code>a</code></p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="assign-value" data-caption="Code" data-completion="0" data-diagnostics="0" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"default","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
<div class="tutorial-exercise-support" data-label="assign-value-solution" data-caption="Code" data-completion="0" data-diagnostics="0" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>a &lt;- 2
a</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Congratulations, you’ve just written (or copied…) your first bit of R code! That wasn’t too hard.</p>
<p>Notice that the value <code>2</code> is printed out to the right of <code>[1]</code>.</p>
<p>As we shall see, all data in R are stored in vectors, which can contain more than one value. <code>[1]</code> here is just indicating that the value printed next to it is the first value in the vector <code>a</code>.</p>
<p>This becomes clearer if we assign the sequence of integers from 1 to 200 to an object called <code>b</code> and then print out its contents. In R, there is a handy short-hand for assigning a sequence of integers using the colon operator, thus: <code>1:200</code>. This notation is shorthand for a vector containing the 200 integer values from 1 to 200.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="assign-integer-vector" data-caption="Code" data-completion="0" data-diagnostics="0" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"default","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
<div class="tutorial-exercise-support" data-label="assign-integer-vector-solution" data-caption="Code" data-completion="0" data-diagnostics="0" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>b &lt;- 1:200
b</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Now the output markers in square brackets make a bit more sense.</p>
<p>But notice also that a single object, <code>b</code>, contains 200 values. That’s because the fundamental data objects in R are, in fact, vectors. We’ll look at vectors in more detail later.</p>
<p>Incidentally, we can use any integers to start and stop the sequence. We don’t have to start at one. We can even have the larger number first and generate the numbers in the vector in reverse order. Try looking at the sequences <code>5:10</code>, <code>-5:0</code> and <code>10:1</code> now.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div id="section-variable-types-in-r" class="section level2">
<h2>Variable types in R</h2>
<p>As with other modern programming languages R supports different <em>types</em> of values</p>
<ul>
<li>integers</li>
<li>doubles (floating point numbers)</li>
<li>strings</li>
<li>logical values (<code>TRUE</code> and <code>FALSE</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s even possible to declare new types of variables which is very important when programming. Having different types stops us from accidentally using one type of value where another is required. We’ll see later with vectors that a vector must contain elements which are all the same type, <em>e.g.</em> all integers or all strings.</p>
<div id="section-the-integer-data-type" class="section level3">
<h3>The integer data type</h3>
<p><em>Integers</em> are whole numbers. In R explicit integer values can be specified by affixing a capital <code>L</code> suffix.</p>
<p>The following are all integers: <code>1L</code>, <code>5L</code>, -2L<code>,</code>0L`.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="integer-data-type" data-caption="Code" data-completion="0" data-diagnostics="0" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>i &lt;- 23L

</div>
<p>Integers and numerics are both numbers and can be compared.</p>
<div class="aside">
<h3 id="section-an-aside">An aside…</h3>
<p>You’ll notice the use of a function here: <code>class(i)</code>. A function in R is a chunk of code that performs a common task, bundled up and given a name for convenience. This is easier (and better practice) than repeating code over and over. A function is passed some information between the <code>()</code> and returns a result. There are many built in functions in R and even more than can be brought into a project from third-party libraries and packages. The <code>class()</code> function takes an R object and returns the information about that object that tells you how the object behaves. You won’t need to use it much but it will show you the <em>type</em> of a datum as R sees it. For example, these integers show up as <code>integer</code>. We’ll see some other types (and some other functions) as we go on.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-the-numeric-floating-point-data-type" class="section level3">
<h3>The numeric (floating-point) data type</h3>
<p>The numeric data type in R is used to store decimal values, and these are equivalent to <em>floating point</em> numbers or <em>reals</em> in other languages.</p>
<div class="under-the-bonnet">
<h3 id="section-under-the-bonnet">Under the bonnet…</h3>
<p>A 64-bit floating point representation is used in the 64-bit version of R (there is no reason these days to use the 32-bit version of R except on some very old computers). It can sometimes be worth knowing the explicit sizes of things when dealing with huge amounts of data but we can ignore this size issue for now.</p>
</div>
<p>Numerics use the same internal format that is used for floating point values in a lot of other languages, and are thus subject to the same precision limitations as they are in nearly every other programming language. In other words, computers can store and represent floating-point or decimal numbers to a very high degree of precision, but they can’t store them <strong>exactly</strong>, or, at least, not all floating point numbers. These precision issues arise because of the way numbers are stored in a finite number of bits. Generally this will only start to be a problem with extremely large or extremely small numbers or when trying to make exact comparisons. Further discussion of this is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but it is always worth bearing in mind. Note that this is not a limitation of R, it is true of <strong>all</strong> commonly used programming languages (including SAS). Just as decimal notation (base 10) is really good at denoting <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{10}\)</span> and not great at representing <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{3}\)</span> a computer which uses binary (base 2) is really good at storing values like <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{16}\)</span> but not so good at representing <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{10}\)</span>.</p>
<p>For now, know that a double can have a fractional part (which may be zero), an integer cannot.</p>
<p>The following are all doubles: <code>1</code>, <code>5</code>, <code>-2</code>, <code>0</code>, <code>2.5</code>, <code>4e9</code>.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="numeric-data-type" data-caption="Code" data-completion="0" data-diagnostics="0" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>n &lt;- 123.456
n
class(n)</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"default","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
<p>Integers and doubles are both numbers and can be compared.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-strings" class="section level3">
<h3>Strings</h3>
<p>Sequences of characters surrounded by quotes <code>""</code> are <em>strings</em>.</p>
<p>A string is not a numeric value and cannot be compared directly with a numeric value. <code>"5"</code> and <code>5</code> are two different values even though they may look the same under some circumstances. Examining them directly in the console or using the environment tab in RStudio will show the difference.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>a = &quot;5&quot;
b = 5
a</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;5&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>b</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 5</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>class(a)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;character&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>class(b)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;numeric&quot;</code></pre>
<p>These values can be compared but such a comparison won’t necessarily give the result one might naïvely expect for reasons we will look at later.</p>
<p>There are whole set of functions for manipulating and looking for patterns within strings which we will look at in another tutorial.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-the-logical-data-type" class="section level3">
<h3>The logical data type</h3>
<p>The values <code>TRUE</code> and <code>FALSE</code> are of a special type <em>logical</em>.</p>
<p>Logical values are used to indicate the results of YES/NO type tests (True/False, Yes/No, 1/0, On/Off types of values) and to create masks which can be used to extract values from vectors.</p>
<p>The logical data type in R is equivalent to the Boolean data type in other languages and is written in R code as the literals <code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code>.</p>
<p>Logicals are returned by comparison expressions. Thus:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="logical-data-type" data-caption="Code" data-completion="0" data-diagnostics="0" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>e &lt;- (3 == 1) # is 3 equal to 1
e
class(e)

f &lt;- (18 &lt; 20) # is 18 less than 20
f
class(f)</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"default","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
<p>We’ll look at these a little more later in this section. Note that <code>==</code> is not a typo but is the operator used for comparison. This is covered in more detail below.</p>
<p>Also note the <em>comment</em> in the code above. Comments in R are prefixed with a <code>#</code> sign.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that for some purposes <code>FALSE</code> is the same as <code>0</code> and <code>TRUE</code> is the same as <code>1</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-special-values-in-r-na-inf--inf-nan-and-null" class="section level2">
<h2>Special values in R: <code>NA</code>, <code>Inf</code>, <code>-Inf</code>, <code>NaN</code> and <code>NULL</code></h2>
<p>R supports several types of special values.</p>
<p>The special value <code>NA</code> is used to indicate the <em>absence</em> of a value, <em>e.g.</em> a missing value or a value which could not be converted properly. This value is very important and we’ll be examining it in more detail later.</p>
<p>The special values <code>Inf</code>, <code>-Inf</code> and <code>NaN</code> are used to indicate the result of certain mathematic operations, <em>e.g.</em> division by zero or the root of negative values.</p>
<p>The value <code>NULL</code> is used to indicate a missing result (in a way different to <code>NA</code>), for example, when no option is available in a <code>switch()</code>.</p>
<div id="section-special-values-na" class="section level3">
<h3>Special values: <code>NA</code></h3>
<p>The most commonly used special value is <code>NA</code>, which stands for ‘not available’ and is used to indicate the <em>absence</em> of a value, <em>e.g.</em> a missing value or a value which could not be converted properly. This value is very important and we’ll be examining it in more detail later. <code>NA</code> indicates ‘there is supposed to be a value but we don’t know what it is.’</p>
<p>In real life, data values are often missing, or unknown, and being able to conveniently represent such missingness using a special value is a powerful feature.</p>
<p>The <code>NA</code> value in R corresponds closely to the <code>None</code> value in Python or <code>nil</code> or <code>null</code> in some other languages.</p>
<p>There are several important things about <code>NA</code> which you should bear in mind when using R.</p>
<p>The first is that comparisons with <code>NA</code> are not possible.</p>
<p>This may be surprising at first (especially if you use SAS or SPSS) but it makes perfect sense, since <code>NA</code> means ‘I don’t know what this value is’ one can’t know what the result of a comparison with <code>NA</code> would be.</p>
<p>Note the error raised if <code>NA</code> is compared to a known value:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="special-values-example-1" data-caption="Code" data-completion="0" data-diagnostics="0" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>e &lt;- NA
e
if (e &gt; 0) {
  print(&quot;e is greater than zero&quot;)
}</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"default","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
<p>Instead, we can use <code>is.na()</code> function to test whether a value is <code>NA</code> or not:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="special-values-example-2" data-caption="Code" data-completion="0" data-diagnostics="0" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>e &lt;- NA

is.na(e)</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"default","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
<p>The other implication of the way R treats <code>NA</code> is that any arithmetic operation involving an <code>NA</code> will always return <code>NA</code> as the result.</p>
<p>This also makes sense, because if we ask ourselves ‘What is the sum of 2 plus 3 plus some unknown value?’, the answer must be ‘I don’t know.’</p>
<p>Try it:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="special-values-example-5" data-caption="Code" data-completion="0" data-diagnostics="0" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>2 + 3 + NA</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"default","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
<p>This propagation of <code>NA</code> in arithmetic and mathematical operations helps ensure consistent and correct results, but it means that even a single <code>NA</code> in a vector of values can result in arithmetic functions operating on that vector returning <code>NA</code> as the result.</p>
<p>Bear in mind this ‘infectious’ nature of <code>NA</code> and we will look at it in more detail later.</p>
<p>It is always good practice to consider whether there might be missing values in your data when using R, and think about how to handle them in your code.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-special-values-inf-and--inf" class="section level3">
<h3>Special values: <code>Inf</code> and <code>-Inf</code></h3>
<p>There are several other special values available in R: <code>Inf</code> and <code>-Inf</code>, <code>NaN</code>, and <code>NULL</code>.</p>

<p>And these:</p>

<pre class="text"><code>a &lt;- 5

# integer division

# exponentiation

</div>
<p>When writing arithmetic or mathematical expressions in R, or any other programming language, always bear in mind the order of precedence of arithmetic operations, and use brackets as necessary.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="operators-example-3" data-caption="Code" data-completion="0" data-diagnostics="0" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>a &lt;- 2

<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"default","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
<div class="tutorial-exercise-support" data-label="operators-example-set-up" data-caption="Code" data-completion="0" data-diagnostics="0" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>a &lt;- 2
b &lt;- 3
c &lt;- 5</code></pre>
</div>
<p>That does not give the same result as:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="operators-example-4" data-caption="Code" data-completion="0" data-diagnostics="0" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>a * (b + c)</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"default","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.setup":"operators-example-set-up","exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
<p>The standard order of operations (which both R and Python use) is:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>honour brackets first</li>
<li>then exponents and roots</li>
<li>then multiplication and division</li>
<li>then addition and subtraction</li>
</ol>
<p>The associativity of operators also matters. Most operators are left-to-right associative. For example:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="operators-example-5" data-caption="Code" data-completion="0" data-diagnostics="0" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>a / b / c</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"default","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.setup":"operators-example-set-up","exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
<p>In the example above, <code>a</code> is first divided by <code>b</code>, and the result of that division is then divided by <code>c</code> (that is, the operators are associated in a left-to-right direction).</p>
<p>Use brackets to override this:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="operators-example-6" data-caption="Code" data-completion="0" data-diagnostics="0" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>a / (b / c)</code></pre>

</div>
<p>The exceptions to the left-to-right associative rule are the exponentiation operator <code>^</code>, and the assignment operator <code>&lt;-</code> (or <code>=</code>):</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="operators-example-7" data-caption="Code" data-completion="0" data-diagnostics="0" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>a ^ b ^ c

</div>
</div>
<div id="section-coding-style" class="section level2">
<h2>Coding style</h2>
<p>This is a good point at which to make a little comment on coding style. Code readability can be massively improved by the use of appropriate white space. Putting a space around operators is a good idea (noting that <code>()</code> are not operators, don’t put spaces inside brackets). This isn’t a hard and fast rule but a guide. The important point is <em>readability</em> not rigid adherence to a rule (this implies the choice of sensible descriptive variable names).</p>
<p>Consider the difference between</p>
<pre><code>x&lt;-a/(b/100)^2</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code>bmi &lt;- weight / (height / 100) ^ 2</code></pre>
<p>When multiple people collaborate on a project it’s important that there’s a shared understanding of an accepted style for the project. The aim is to not to develop a style that pleases everyone (that’s rarely possible) but which offends everyone equally 😁.</p>
<p>In other words, you shouldn’t try to please everyone but in all likelihood someone will complain about something. You might like to read some style guides:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml">Google’s R Style Guide</a></li>
<li><a href="http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html">the style guide from <em>Advanced R</em></a></li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t have to read these now, they contain a lot of things we haven’t covered yet, but if you come back here at the end of the tutorial and read them and they’ll make a lot more sense.</p>
