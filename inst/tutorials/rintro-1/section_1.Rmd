## What is R?

R is a high-level, open-source programming language.

'High-level' means that the language abstracts away (hides) many of the arcane and messy details of writing program code to run on a computer. 

This allows a programmer to concentrate on the task rather than on the characteristics of computer on which it will run. 

It also means that such high-level program code tends to be highly portable.
Code written on one type of computer, say, under macOS, will run unchanged (or almost unchanged) on, say, a Windows- or Linux-based computer. 

## The origins of R

The origins of R lie in a language called S, which was developed by the AT&T telecommunications company (formerly the Bell Telephone Company)
in the US in the late 1970s and early 1980s, to speed up statistical analysis of telephone call and customer data. 

The S language became a commercial software product called S/Plus,
which rapidly became the language of choice for many statisticians,
particularly those developing new statistical methods.

In the early 1990s, two statisticians at the University of Auckland in New Zealand, Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman,
decided to create an alternative to the S language, which was closely modelled on it,
but which could be freely used on computers in their university without having to pay license fees. 

They named this language R (after their shared first initial, and as a pun on the name 'S'). 

Over the course of the 1990s and 2000s, R rapidly became very popular with statisticians,
particularly those who were already using S or S/Plus,
and eventually came to be arguably the dominant programming language for statistics and statistical graphics,
and one of the most popular programming languages for data science, currently second only to Python. 

## Free, open-source software

Open-source software is software that is made available under a licence that allows others to use and/or modify the software code.

Although this sounds like a recipe for chaos and anarchy,
in practice it works very well and open-source software is now very widely used almost everywhere,
including in mission-critical areas.
Indeed, much of the internet runs on computers running the Linux operating system: Linux is open-source software.

The free, open-source licensing for both R and Python means that anyone can install them on as many computers as they wish
without having to pay any licensing fees. 

This is a tremendous advantage: it means that skills in Python and R are highly portable between jobs or projects,
because the software on which those skills have been acquired can be installed anywhere. 

It also facilitates the use of Python and R with 'big data', which may require the use of many computers simultaneously,
all running the same program code on different parts of the data in parallel. 

## Software ecosystems

The open-source licensing of both Python and R also means that anyone can modify or add to these software environments. 

This has resulted in the growth of very large software ecosystems for both Python and R,
in which (literally) tens of thousands of people have contributed extensions, add-in-packages and improvements for both languages. 

For R, there is a large curated repository of such contributed code, called [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/) _(The Comprehensive R Archive Network)_,
containing over 11,000 contributed packages, and growing rapidly. 

So, in summary, R is a fully-featured, 'industrial-strength' programming language which is mature and highly trusted,
and is very suitable for most data science and data analysis tasks. 

## Which is better - R or some other language like Python? 

Neither.
Choosing to concentrate on a single language for all things would  be a mistake.
While all modern computing languages are computationally equivalent (they can ultimately perform the same calculations)
individually they have strength and weaknesses and certain things may be easier in one language or another.

It can be argued that R has better support for both traditional and cutting-edge statistical analyses,
but R has excellent support for many sub-disciplines like machine learning, geospatial data manipulation, graph data support among others.

As a result, many data scientists are now using R as part of their toolkit,
leveraging the particular strengths of the language where and when needed.

R includes excellent features for working with other languages.
For example, there is a very efficient data interchange format ([_feather_](https://github.com/wesm/feather)),
which allows the combination of R and Python code in a single project.
It is even possible to _embed_ a Python interpreter in R using the [_reticulate_](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/index.html) package,
and an R interpreter in Python using the [_RPy2_](https://rpy2.bitbucket.io) package, allowing you to use both languages at once, sharing data in-memory.

## A (not-so) quick introduction to programming in R

This tutorial provides a quick introduction to programming in the R language.
It is not intended as a comprehensive treatise on the R language,
but rather as an introduction to give an idea of what it is like to write programs in R. 

R requires you to write code to get most things done.
There are no point-and-click interfaces that will do everything that you need to do: writing code is inescapable.

But that's a **Good Thing™**, because actions performed through code are repeatable and reproducible actions,
and the code coupled with a good source control system automatically provides an audit trail of how data has been manipulated
and the process of arriving at the final analysis.

## Names, objects and the assignment operator in R

First up, assignment.

R uses the compound symbol `<-` to associate a value with a name.

Python and many other languages use `=` for this purpose,
and a single equals sign also works for assignment in R too, but by convention, `<-` is used instead.

In R, just referring to the name of an object by itself on a line is equivalent to printing out its value on the screen or console or output device,
that is, the same as using the `print()` function.

In the code box below, assign the value `2` to an object named `a`, and examine the value of `a`

```{r assign-value, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r assign-value-solution}
a <- 2
a
```

Congratulations, you've just written (or copied...) your first bit of R code! That wasn't too hard.

Notice that the value `2` is printed out to the right of `[1]`. 

As we shall see, all data in R are stored in vectors, which can contain more than one value.
`[1]` here is just indicating that the value printed next to it is the first value in the vector `a`. 

This becomes clearer if we assign the sequence of integers from 1 to 200 to an object called `b` and then print out its contents.
In R, there is a handy short-hand for assigning a sequence of integers using the colon operator, thus: `1:200`.
This notation is shorthand for a vector containing the 200 integer values from 1 to 200. 

```{r assign-integer-vector, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r assign-integer-vector-solution}
b <- 1:200
b
```

Now the output markers in square brackets make a bit more sense.

But notice also that a single object, `b`, contains 200 values.
That's because the fundamental data objects in R are, in fact, vectors.
We'll look at vectors in more detail later.

Incidentally, we can use any integers to start and stop the sequence.
We don't have to start at one.
We can even have the larger number first and generate the numbers in the vector in reverse order.
Try looking at the sequences `5:10`, `-5:0` and `10:1` now.

```{r integer-vector, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r integer-vector-solution}
5:10
-5:0
10:1
```

## Variable types in R

As with other modern programming languages R supports different _types_ of values

  * integers
  * doubles (floating point numbers)
  * strings
  * logical values (`TRUE` and `FALSE`)

It's even possible to declare new types of variables which is very important when programming.
Having different types stops us from accidentally using one type of value where another is required.
We'll see later with vectors that a vector must contain elements which are all the same type,
_e.g._ all integers or all strings.

### The integer data type

_Integers_ are whole numbers.
In R explicit integer values can be specified by affixing a capital `L` suffix.

The following are all integers: `1L`, `5L`, -2L`, `0L`.

```{r integer-data-type, exercise=TRUE}
i <- 23L
i
class(i)
```

Integers and numerics are both numbers and can be compared.

<div class="aside">
### An aside...

You'll notice the use of a function here: `class(i)`.
A function in R is a chunk of code that performs a common task, bundled up and given a name for convenience.
This is easier (and better practice) than repeating code over and over.
A function is passed some information between the `()` and returns a result.
There are many built in functions in R and even more than can be brought into a project from third-party libraries and packages.
The `class()` function takes an R object and returns the information about that object that tells you how the object behaves.
You won't need to use it much but it will show you the _type_ of a datum as R sees it.
For example, these integers show up as `integer`.
We'll see some other types (and some other functions) as we go on.
</div>

### The numeric (floating-point) data type

The numeric data type in R is used to store decimal values,
and these are equivalent to _floating point_ numbers or _reals_ in other languages. 

<div class="under-the-bonnet">
### Under the bonnet...
A 64-bit floating point representation is used in the 64-bit version of R
(there is no reason these days to use the 32-bit version of R except on some very old computers).
It can sometimes be worth knowing the explicit sizes of things when dealing with huge amounts of data
but we can ignore this size issue for now.
</div>

Numerics use the same internal format that is used for floating point values in a lot of other languages,
and are thus subject to the same precision limitations as they are in nearly every other programming language.
In other words, computers can store and represent floating-point or decimal numbers to a very high degree of precision,
but they can't store them **exactly**, or, at least, not all floating point numbers.
These precision issues arise because of the way numbers are stored in a finite number of bits.
Generally this will only start to be a problem with extremely large or extremely small numbers or when trying to make exact comparisons.
Further discussion of this is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but it is always worth bearing in mind.
Note that this is not a limitation of R, it is true of **all** commonly used programming languages (including SAS).
Just as decimal notation (base 10) is really good at denoting $\frac{1}{10}$ and not great at representing $\frac{1}{3}$
a computer which uses binary (base 2) is really good at storing values like $\frac{1}{2}$ and $\frac{1}{16}$
but not so good at representing $\frac{1}{10}$.

For now, know that a double can have a fractional part (which may be zero), an integer cannot.

The following are all doubles: `1`, `5`, `-2`, `0`, `2.5`, `4e9`.

```{r numeric-data-type, exercise=TRUE}
n <- 123.456
n
class(n)
```

Integers and doubles are both numbers and can be compared.

### Strings

Sequences of characters surrounded by quotes `""` are _strings_.

A string is not a numeric value and cannot be compared directly with a numeric value.
`"5"` and `5` are two different values even though they may look the same under some circumstances.
Examining them directly in the console or using the environment tab in RStudio will show the difference.

```{r strings-not-numerics, echo=TRUE}
a = "5"
b = 5
a
b
class(a)
class(b)
```

These values can be compared but such a comparison won't necessarily give the result one might naïvely expect for reasons we will look at later.

There are whole set of functions for manipulating and looking for patterns within strings which we will look at in another tutorial.

### The logical data type

The values `TRUE` and `FALSE` are of a special type _logical_.

Logical values are used to indicate the results of YES/NO type tests
(True/False, Yes/No, 1/0, On/Off types of values)
and to create masks which can be used to extract values from vectors.

The logical data type in R is equivalent to the Boolean data type in other languages
and is written in R code as the literals `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

Logicals are returned by comparison expressions. Thus:

```{r logical-data-type, exercise=TRUE}
e <- (3 == 1) # is 3 equal to 1
e
class(e)

f <- (18 < 20) # is 18 less than 20
f
class(f)
```

We'll look at these a little more later in this section.
Note that `==` is not a typo but is the operator used for comparison.
This is covered in more detail below.

Also note the _comment_ in the code above.
Comments in R are prefixed with a `#` sign.

It's worth noting that for some purposes `FALSE` is the same as `0` and `TRUE` is the same as `1`.

## Special values in R: `NA`, `Inf`, `-Inf`, `NaN` and `NULL`

R supports several types of special values.

The special value `NA` is used to indicate the _absence_ of a value,
_e.g._ a missing value or a value which could not be converted properly.
This value is very important and we'll be examining it in more detail later.

The special values `Inf`, `-Inf` and `NaN` are used to indicate the result of certain mathematic operations,
_e.g._ division by zero or the root of negative values.

The value `NULL` is used to indicate a missing result (in a way different to `NA`),
for example, when no option is available in a `switch()`.

### Special values: `NA`

The most commonly used special value is `NA`,
which stands for 'not available' and is used to indicate the _absence_ of a value,
_e.g._ a missing value or a value which could not be converted properly.
This value is very important and we'll be examining it in more detail later.
`NA` indicates 'there is supposed to be a value but we don't know what it is.'

In real life, data values are often missing, or unknown,
and being able to conveniently represent such missingness using a special value is a powerful feature.

The `NA` value in R corresponds closely to the `None` value in Python or `nil` or `null` in some other languages.

There are several important things about `NA` which you should bear in mind when using R.

The first is that comparisons with `NA` are not possible.

This may be surprising at first (especially if you use SAS or SPSS) but it makes perfect sense,
since `NA` means 'I don't know what this value is' one can't know what the result of a comparison with `NA` would be.

Note the error raised if `NA` is compared to a known value:

```{r special-values-example-1, exercise=TRUE}
e <- NA
e
if (e > 0) {
  print("e is greater than zero")
}
```

Instead, we can use `is.na()` function to test whether a value is `NA` or not:

```{r special-values-example-2, exercise=TRUE}
e <- NA

is.na(e)
```

The other implication of the way R treats `NA` is that any arithmetic operation involving an `NA` will always return `NA` as the result.

This also makes sense, because if we ask ourselves 'What is the sum of 2 plus 3 plus some unknown value?',
the answer must be 'I don't know.'

Try it:

```{r special-values-example-5, exercise=TRUE}
2 + 3 + NA
```

This propagation of `NA` in arithmetic and mathematical operations helps ensure consistent and correct results,
but it means that even a single `NA` in a vector of values
can result in arithmetic functions operating on that vector returning `NA` as the result.

Bear in mind this 'infectious' nature of `NA` and we will look at it in more detail later.

It is always good practice to consider whether there might be missing values in your data when using R,
and think about how to handle them in your code.

### Special values: `Inf` and `-Inf`

There are several other special values available in R: `Inf` and `-Inf`, `NaN`, and `NULL`.

`Inf` and `-Inf` represent infinity and minus infinity, and are thus greater and less than any other number, respectively.

Use the `is.infinite()` function to determine whether a value is infinite.

Consider the case of division by zero:

```{r special-values-example-9, exercise=TRUE}
a <- 3.2 / 0
a
class(a)
is.infinite(a)
```

Note that this behaviour is different to many other languages,
which throw a runtime error (or raises a runtime exception) when division by zero is attempted
(or even continue with undefined behaviour).

### Special values: `NaN`

`NaN` in R represents 'Not a Number' and is used wherever a numeric value is not a number.

This sounds like a contradiction, but consider the following mathematical operation
(the `sqrt()` function returns the square root of its argument).
Note the warning message from R.

```{r special-values-example-10, exercise=TRUE}
a <- -4
b <- sqrt(a)
b
class(b)
is.nan(b)
```

### Special values: `NULL`

`NULL` in R represents 'there is no value.'

Note that this is different from `NA` which represents a 'missing' value,
_i.e._ `NA` there is supposed to be a value but we don't know what it is.
`NULL` is used, for example, when no option is available in a `switch()`.

Use the `is.null()` function to determine whether a value is `NULL`.

### Activity: special values

Write R code for

  * two expressions
    * each using a different R mathematical function (try finding root and log)
    * that return a `NaN` value when certain values are used.

```{r special-values-exercise-1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=12}

```

```{r special-values-exercise-1-hint}
# square root of -3
a <- sqrt(-3)
a

# log of a negative number
b <- log(-3)
b
```

### The complex data type

Complex numbers are like real numbers but have an additional imaginary part.
They are used in particular types of mathematical calculations,
and allow otherwise impossible calculations such as taking the square root of a negative number. 

R supports complex numbers as a built-in data type,
but we will not discuss them further in this tutorial.
The `complex()` function is used to create a complex number in R.

```{r complex-data-type, exercise=TRUE}
cmplx <- complex(real=123.4567, imaginary=3)
cmplx
class(cmplx)
```

## Arithmetic expressions in R

R uses fairly standard arithmetic operators, the same as or very similar to many other programming languages.
Examine the output of the following (after running the code):

```{r operators-example-1, exercise=TRUE}
a <- 5
b <- 2

# addition
a + b

# subtraction
a - b

# multiplication
a * b

# division
a / b
```

And these:

```{r operators-example-2, exercise=TRUE}
a <- 5
b <- 2

# integer division
a %/% b

# exponentiation
a^b

# same as
a**b

# modulus (remainder)
a %% b
```

When writing arithmetic or mathematical expressions in R, or any other programming language,
always bear in mind the order of precedence of arithmetic operations, and use brackets as necessary.

```{r operators-example-3, exercise=TRUE}
a <- 2
b <- 3
c <- 5

a * b + c
```

```{r operators-example-set-up}
a <- 2
b <- 3
c <- 5
```

That does not give the same result as:

```{r operators-example-4, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="operators-example-set-up"}
a * (b + c)
```

The standard order of operations (which both R and Python use) is:

  1. honour brackets first
  1. then exponents and roots
  1. then multiplication and division
  1. then addition and subtraction

The associativity of operators also matters. Most operators are left-to-right associative. For example:

```{r operators-example-5, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="operators-example-set-up"}
a / b / c
```

In the example above, `a` is first divided by `b`, and the result of that division is then divided by `c`
(that is, the operators are associated in a left-to-right direction).

Use brackets to override this:

```{r operators-example-6, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="operators-example-set-up"}
a / (b / c)
```

The exceptions to the left-to-right associative rule are the exponentiation operator `^`, and the assignment operator `<-` (or `=`):

```{r operators-example-7, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="operators-example-set-up"}
a ^ b ^ c

a ^ (b ^ c) # same as a ^ b ^ c

(a ^ b) ^ c
```

## Coding style

This is a good point at which to make a little comment on coding style.
Code readability can be massively improved by the use of appropriate white space.
Putting a space around operators is a good idea (noting that `()` are not operators, don't put spaces inside brackets).
This isn't a hard and fast rule but a guide.
The important point is _readability_ not rigid adherence to a rule (this implies the choice of sensible descriptive variable names).

Consider the difference between

```
x<-a/(b/100)^2
```

and

```
bmi <- weight / (height / 100) ^ 2
```

When multiple people collaborate on a project it's important that there's a shared understanding of an accepted style for the project.
The aim is to not to develop a style that pleases everyone (that's rarely possible) but which offends everyone equally 😁.

In other words, you shouldn't try to please everyone but in all likelihood someone will complain about something.
You might like to read some style guides:

 * [Google's R Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml)
 * [the style guide from _Advanced R_](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html)
 
You don't have to read these now, they contain a lot of things we haven't covered yet,
but if you come back here at the end of the tutorial and read them and they'll make a lot more sense.

## Comparison and logical expressions in R

### Comparison expressions

The comparison operators in R are the same as many other programming languages.

They compare two values or expressions and return `TRUE` or `FALSE` (or `NA`, as we shall see later)
depending on whether the comparison expression is true or false.

We will be using the following variables:

```
a <- 2
b <- 3
```

```{r comparisons-example-set-up}
a <- 2
b <- 3
```

```{r comparisons-example-1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="comparisons-example-set-up"}
# less than
a < b
```

```{r comparisons-example-2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="comparisons-example-set-up"}
# less than or equal to
a <= b
```

You should complete the following in the same vein, comparing `a` to `b` using the given comparison and run each.

```{r comparisons-example-3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="comparisons-example-set-up"}
# greater than


```

```{r comparisons-example-3-hint}
a > b
```

```{r comparisons-example-4, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="comparisons-example-set-up"}
# greater than or equal to


```

The double equals sign operator `==` is used for equality comparisons,
not a single equals sign `=`. The single equals sign `=` is the same as the assignemnt operator `<-` in R as previously mentioned.

```{r comparisons-example-5, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="comparisons-example-set-up"}
# exactly equal to - note double equals signs
a == b

```

As with many programming languages `!` is associated with negation.
The exclamation mark `!` is the negation operator in R.
The 'not equal to' operator is `!=`

```{r comparisons-example-6, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="comparisons-example-set-up"}
# not equal to
a != b

```

### Logical expressions

The logical operators are also important, and differ from those used in some other languages:

```
d <- TRUE
e <- FALSE
f <- TRUE
```

```{r logical-comparisons-set-up}
d <- TRUE
e <- FALSE
f <- TRUE
```

```{r comparisons-example-7, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="logical-comparisons-set-up"}
# and (logical conjunction)
d & e
d & f
```


```{r comparisons-example-8, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="logical-comparisons-set-up"}
# or (logical disjunction)
d | e
d | f
```

```{r comparisons-example-8a, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="logical-comparisons-set-up"}
# exclusive or (logical exclusive disjunction)
xor(d, e)
xor(d, f)
```

<div id="comparisons-example-8a-hint">
_Exclusive or_ is true if and only if only one of its arguments is true.
Exclusive or in R is a function of two arguments `xor()`.

|  A    |  B    | xor(A, B) |
|:-----:|:-----:|:---------:|
| TRUE  | TRUE  | FALSE     |
| TRUE  | FALSE | TRUE      |
| FALSE | TRUE  | TRUE      |
| FALSE | FALSE | FALSE     |
</div>


```{r comparisons-example-9, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="logical-comparisons-set-up"}
# not (logical negation)
!d
!e
!(d == e)
```

```{r comparisons-example-10, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="logical-comparisons-set-up"}
# testing if a value is TRUE
d == TRUE

# equivalent
isTRUE(d)
```

```{r comparisons-example-11, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="logical-comparisons-set-up"}
# testing if a value is FALSE
e == FALSE
# equivalent
!isTRUE(e)
```

## Summary

This concludes section 1 and our overview of basic assignment and arithmetic and logical operators.

Continue with section 2 where we will look at some basic R data structures including the all-important _vector_.
