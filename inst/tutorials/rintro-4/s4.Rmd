## Overview

This tutorial is broken into six sections.

This section deals with mainly with _data frames._

 * The factor data type
 * Data frames
 * Subsetting data frames
 * `attach()`, `detach()` and `with()`
 * Combining and merging data frames 
 * Reading data from CSV files
 * Reading data from databases

## The factor data type

There is a core data type in R which we haven't yet mentioned: the _factor_ data type.

Factors are used to represent and store _categorical data_ or _ordinal data._
Categorical data are things with a finite number of possible values (the number of possible values is called the _cardinality_).
Phenotypic sex is an example, and might be represented by, say, the categories female, male, indeterminant and missing (`NA`).

These could readily be stored in a character vector, such as the following vector for a set of 8 patients:

```{r exercise=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
sex <- c("Male", "Male", "Female", "Indeterminate", NA, "Indeterminate", "Female", "Female")
```

That works OK, but each character string in the vector takes up quite a lot of space in the computer's memory
(and remember that R stores all working data in memory), which can be a problem with very large data sets.
It also allows us to accidentally add data with misspelt categories:

```{r factors-examples-set-up-a}
sex <- c("Male", "Male", "Female", "Indeterminate", NA, "Indeterminate", "Female", "Female")
sex_factor <- factor(sex)
```

```{r factors-example-2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="factors-examples-set-up-a"}
# "Indeterminant" is a misspelling
sex <- c("Male", "Male", "Female", "Indeterminate", NA, "Indeterminant", "Female", "Female")
sum(sex == "Male", na.rm=TRUE) +
    sum(sex == "Female", na.rm=TRUE) +
    sum(sex == "Indeterminate", na.rm=TRUE) +
    sum(is.na(sex))
```

As you can see, the above code does not sum to `r length(sex)` because of the misspelt value.

A similar issue is that using strings allows values which aren't just misspelt but which aren't even part of the category domain.

```{r factors-example-2a, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="factors-examples-set-up-a"}
# "Unknown" is not a valid value for phenotypic sex
sex <- c("Male", "Male", "Female", "Unknown", NA, "Indeterminate", "Female", "Female")
sum(sex == "Male", na.rm=TRUE) +
    sum(sex == "Female", na.rm=TRUE) +
    sum(sex == "Indeterminate", na.rm=TRUE) +
    sum(is.na(sex))
```

The factor data type overcomes both these problems.
Factors efficiently store categorical data in memory,
and ensure that only the predefined categories can be included in the factor vector.

Also, many statistical (or machine learning) functions, such as model fitting,
need to treat categorical data differently from numeric data.

If data are stored using the factor data type,
these functions will handle the factor type and treat those data columns appropriately in the model fitting process.

Factors are created using the `factor()` or `as.factor()` functions:

```{r factors-example-4, exercise=FALSE, echo=TRUE, exercise.setup="factors-examples-set-up-a"}
sex_factor <- factor(sex)
sex_factor
class(sex)
class(sex_factor)
```

We can see what the defined levels (categories) are for a factor using the `levels()` function.

```{r factors-example-5, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="factors-examples-set-up-a"}
levels(sex_factor)
```

Note that attempts to add data containing undefined levels to a factor vector will result in a warning and an `NA` being inserted instead:

```{r factors-example-6, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="factors-examples-set-up-a"}
sex_factor[9] <- "Unknown"
sex_factor
```

Factors are also useful for applying meaningful labels to coded values (similar to 'formats' in the SAS language):

```{r factors-example-7, exercise=TRUE}
# here 1 represents male, 2 represents female
sex <- c(1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1)
sex
```

```{r factors-examples-set-up-b}
sex <- c(1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1)
sex_factor <- factor(sex, levels=c(1, 2), labels=c("Male", "Female"))
```

```{r factors-example-8, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="factors-examples-set-up-b"}
sex_factor <- factor(sex, levels=c(1, 2), labels=c("Male", "Female"))
sex_factor
```

Note that the labels for a factor must be used in logical comparison expressions, not the levels:

```{r factors-example-9, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="factors-examples-set-up-b"}
x <- sex_factor[sex_factor == 1]
x
length(x)
```

```{r factors-example-10, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="factors-examples-set-up-b"}
y <- sex_factor[sex_factor == "Male"]
y
length(y)
```

Factors may also be ordered, that is, they may be categories which have a natural order, in which case they are referred to as _ordinals_:

```{r ordinals-example-1, exercise=TRUE}
pain <- ordered(c(2, 3, 3, 1, 4, 3, 5, 1), levels=1:5, 
                labels=c("No pain", "A little pain", "Some pain", "Very painful", "Excruciating"))
pain
class(pain) # note this returns two classes!
```

Because they are discrete categories without any natural order or ranking
the values of a factor cannot be compared with each other, except for equality.
Ordinals, however, can be compared with each other, and ranked:

```{r factors-examples-set-up-c}
sex <- c(1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1)
sex_factor <- factor(sex, levels=c(1,2), labels=c("Male", "Female"))
pain <- ordered(c(2, 3, 3, 1, 4, 3, 5, 1), levels=1:5, 
                labels=c("No pain", "A little pain", "Some pain", "Very painful", "Excruciating"))
```


```{r ordinals-example-2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="factors-examples-set-up-c"}
sex_factor[1]
sex_factor[3]
# trying to compare factors without an ordering fails
sex_factor[1] > sex_factor[3]
```


```{r ordinals-example-3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="factors-examples-set-up-c"}
pain[1]
pain[5]
# ordinals (factors with an ordering) can be compared
pain[5] < pain[1]
```

### Creating a factor from continuous numeric data

A very common requirement is to divide a continuous numeric variable into groups,
such as dividing an age variable (measured in years) into, say, 10-year age groups.

In many programming languages, you would use a series of `if...then...else` or `case` statements to allocate each age value to an age group.
You can do that in R too, of course, but R also provides a convenience function for this task: `cut()`

`cut()` takes a numeric vector (which could be a column in a data frame), and a vector of cut-points,and returns a factor vector.
An example makes this clearer.

First, let's create a numeric vector called `age` and fill it with 2000 random values between 0 and 100.
Let's claim these are the ages of marathon runners, in fractional years:

```{r cut-examples-set-up-a}
set.seed(111)
age <- rlnorm(2000, log(32), log(1.3))
cut_points <- seq(0, 100, by=10)
```

```{r cut-example-1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="cut-examples-set-up-a"}
age <- rlnorm(2000, log(32), log(1.3))
# Examine the first 20 values
head(age, n=20)
```

```{r cut-example-2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="cut-examples-set-up-a"}
# examine the distribution using a histogram
hist(age, breaks=50, xlim=range(0, 100))
```

We explicitly set the limits for the x-axis of the graph here to avoid plotting artefacts from the range of values we're plotting,
_i.e._ it's to make the plot look nicer.
Try taking out the `xlim=range(0, 100)` argument to see.

OK, now let's create a new vector which contains an age group factor value for each of those 2000 age values, using `cut()`.
We can use the `seq()` function to conveniently create a vector of cut-points.

```{r cut-example-3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="cut-examples-set-up-a"}
cut_points <- seq(0, 100, by=10)
cut_points

# use the cut_points vector to divide age into age groups
# we use right=FALSE because we want our intervals to be closed on the left and open on the right: [a, b)
# we use include.lowest=TRUE because we want values on the open boundary of the edge bin to be included
agegrp <- cut(age, breaks=cut_points, include.lowest=TRUE, right=FALSE)

# check the class of agegrp
class(agegrp)

# it's a factor, so let's check the valid levels of agegrp
levels(agegrp)
```

Notice that `cut()` has automatically constructed factor labels based on the cut-points we specified.
You can manually provide nicer labels if you wish and you'll usually want to do this.
Automatically generated factor labels based on numeric intervals can be completely accurate yet completely unreadable.

Also, since age group has an intrinsic ordering, we can ask `cut()` to create an ordered factor using an additional argument:

```{r cut-example-4, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="cut-examples-set-up-a"}
agegrp_labels <- c('0-9 yrs', '10-19 yrs', '20-29 yrs', '30-39 yrs', '40-49 yrs',
                   '50-59 yrs', '60-69 yrs', '70-79 yrs', '80-89 yrs', '90+ yrs')
agegrp <- cut(age, breaks=cut_points, labels=agegrp_labels, include.lowest=TRUE, right=FALSE, ordered_result=TRUE)
class(agegrp)
levels(agegrp)
```

```{r cut-examples-set-up-b}
set.seed(111)
age <- rlnorm(2000, log(32), log(1.3))
cut_points <- seq(0, 100, by=10)
agegrp_labels <- c('0-9 yrs', '10-19 yrs', '20-29 yrs', '30-39 yrs', '40-49 yrs',
                   '50-59 yrs', '60-69 yrs', '70-79 yrs', '80-89 yrs', '90+ yrs')
agegrp <- cut(age, breaks=cut_points, labels=agegrp_labels, include.lowest=TRUE, right=FALSE, ordered_result=TRUE)
```

```{r cut-example-5, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="cut-examples-set-up-b"}
# print the first few values of agegrp
head(agegrp)
```

```{r cut-example-6, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="cut-examples-set-up-b"}
# print a frequency table of agegrp
table(agegrp)
```

```{r cut-example-7, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="cut-examples-set-up-b"}
# finally, notice that a bar chart of the frequencies of agegrp mirrors the distribution of age
hist(age, breaks = 10, xlim=range(0, 100))
barplot(table(agegrp), las=2)
```

Note: the `las=2` argument rotates the x-axis labels by 90Â°.

Enough about factors.
It's important to know what they are as they are very useful and we'll be using them as we go on to talk about data frames.

## Data frames

Data frames are central to most data management and manipulation tasks in R.

Data frames in R are a special type of data structure in which each element is
a vector representing a column of data in a rectangular (tabular) data structure.

The vectors are constrained such that each column of a data frame must have the same number of elements in the vector which comprises it.
Since all the columns in a data frame must have the same number of rows,
each column vector in a data frame must have the same number of elements (be the same length).

A data frame is therefore a tabular (rectangular) data structure.
Each row is a record (_observation_) and each column is a _variable_, to use a common terminology.

Note, however, that data frames are created column-wise,
not row-wise as is more usual with databases or in systems like SAS or SPSS.

This is easier to understand with an example.
The `data.frame()` function is used to construct data frame objects:

```{r data-frames-example-1, exercise=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
patients_df <- data.frame(id=c(123, 876, 935, 263),
                          sex=c("F", "F", "M", "F"),
                          age=c(23, 47, 36, 78),
                          height=c(167, 181, 178, 163),
                          weight=c(63.2, 76.9, 86.3, 57.2))

patients_df

class(patients_df)
```

```{r data-frames-examples-set-up-a}
patients_df <- data.frame(id=c(123, 876, 935, 263),
                          sex=c("F", "F", "M", "F"),
                          age=c(23, 47, 36, 78),
                          height=c(167, 181, 178, 163),
                          weight=c(63.2, 76.9, 86.3, 57.2))
```

```{r data-frames-examples-set-up-b}
patients_df <- data.frame(id=c(123, 876, 935, 263),
                          sex=c("F", "F", "M", "F"),
                          age=c(23, 47, 36, 78),
                          height=c(167, 181, 178, 163),
                          weight=c(63.2, 76.9, 86.3, 57.2))
rownames(patients_df) <- c("Wilma", "Betty", "Fred", "Pebbles")
colnames(patients_df)[4] <- "height_in_cm"
```

We can examine (and manipulate) the names of the columns in a data frame:

```{r data-frames-example-2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="data-frames-examples-set-up-a"}
names(patients_df)

# or the same thing
colnames(patients_df)

# rows can have names too in data frames
rownames(patients_df)
```

Data frames by default have row names which are just sequential numbers, but the row names can be used to hold more meaningful data.

However, it is generally a better idea to store any data that you may need to use to filter by row on
or carry out calculations on as a column in the data frame itself,
rather than in the rowname attribute for each row.

Column names can be modified using the `names()` or `colnames()` function:

```{r data-frames-example-3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="data-frames-examples-set-up-a"}
rownames(patients_df) <- c("Wilma", "Betty", "Fred", "Pebbles")

colnames(patients_df)[4] <- "height_in_cm"

patients_df
```

Individual values in a data frame can be referenced using the same square brackets operators as used for vectors, matrices and arrays,
specifying the row index first and then the column:

```{r data-frames-example-4, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="data-frames-examples-set-up-b"}
# row 2, column 2
patients_df[2, 2]
```

```{r data-frames-example-5, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="data-frames-examples-set-up-b"}
# all rows except row 2, all columns except column 2
patients_df[-2, -2] 
```

```{r data-frames-example-6, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="data-frames-examples-set-up-b"}
# rows 3 and 4, columns 3 and 5
patients_df[c(3, 4), c(3, 5)]
```

You can select cells in a data frame by name.

```{r data-frames-example-7, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="data-frames-examples-set-up-b"}
# row named Fred, column named age (returns a single value)
patients_df["Fred", "age"]
# the sex and age of Fred and Wilma (returns a data frame)
patients_df[c("Fred", "Wilma"), c("sex", "age")]
```

In our example both columns and rows have names but usually only columns have names.
It's more common, therefore to select rows using an index vector or even more commonly by a logical vector.

```{r data-frames-example-8, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="data-frames-examples-set-up-b"}
patients_df[c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE),]
```

Notice the trailing `,` between the `[ ]`.
A common mistake is to leave this out and end up subsetting by column rather than row.

<div class="under-the-bonnet">
### Under the bonnet...

Data frames are just specialised versions of lists.
Operations that can be performed on lists are performed the same way on data frames.
Hence, leaving out the `,` means columns are being selected rather than rows.
</div>

```{r exercise=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
mask <- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)
```

Notice the difference in result with and without the `,`.
With the `,` we are selecting rows.
Without the `,` we are selecting columns.
There are `r length(patients_df)` columns so the masking vector gets recycled and effectively turned into the mask
<code>`r paste0("c(", paste(rep(mask, length(patients_df))[1:length(patients_df)], collapse=", "), ")")`</code>
to select the columns from `patients_df` where the mask is `TRUE`.

```{r data-frames-example-8a, exercise=FALSE, echo=TRUE, exercise.setup="data-frames-examples-set-up-b"}
# select by row
patients_df[c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE),]
# select by column (missing ,)
patients_df[c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)]
```

However, it's also quite common to select columns from a data frame by name.
Note that both of these give the same result but one has a `,` and one does not.

```{r data-frames-example-8b, exercise=FALSE, echo=TRUE, exercise.setup="data-frames-examples-set-up-b"}
# select columns by name using row, column notation
patients_df[,c("sex", "weight")]
# select columns by name treating the data frame as a list of named columns
patients_df[c("sex", "weight")]
```

### The $ notation for accessing columns

To select a single column we can use a special notation involving `$`.
Named columns in a data frame can be referenced using the notation `data_frame$column_name`,
_e.g._ `patients_df$sex`.
This references just that column vector and acts just like that column vector
so everything one can do to a vector one can do to a column of a data frame using this notation

```{r data-frames-example-8c, exercise=FALSE, echo=TRUE, exercise.setup="data-frames-examples-set-up-b"}
# select the height column
patients_df$height
# select the weight column
patients_df$weight
```

<div class="under-the-bonnet">
### Under the bonnet...

If you worked through section 3 on lists you will have seen this notation.
Data frames are just specialised versions of lists so the `$` notation works on them as well.
</div>

### Adding a new column to a data frame

To add a column, we can use any of these methods:

```{r data-frames-example-9, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="data-frames-examples-set-up-b"}
# using row, column notation
patients_df[,"postcode"] <- c("2202", "3405", "2022", "2119")
# using $ to explicitly name a column
patients_df$country_of_birth <- c("Australia", "Germany", "Indonesia", "UK")
# using list notation
# nrow() returns the number of rows in a data frame
patients_df["fives"] <- rep(5, nrow(patients_df))

patients_df
```

```{r data-frames-examples-set-up-c}
patients_df <- data.frame(id=c(123, 876, 935, 263),
                          sex=c("F", "F", "M", "F"),
                          age=c(23, 47, 36, 78),
                          height=c(167, 181, 178, 163),
                          weight=c(63.2, 76.9, 86.3, 57.2))
rownames(patients_df) <- c("Wilma", "Betty", "Fred", "Pebbles")
colnames(patients_df)[4] <- "height_in_cm"
patients_df[,"postcode"] <- c("2202", "3405", "2022", "2119")
patients_df$country_of_birth <- c("Australia", "Germany", "Indonesia", "UK")
patients_df$fives <- rep(5, 4)
```

Similarly, columns can be deleted by assigning NULL to them:

```{r data-frames-example-10, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="data-frames-examples-set-up-c"}
patients_df$country_of_birth <- NULL

patients_df
```

```{r data-frames-examples-set-up-d}
patients_df <- data.frame(id=c(123, 876, 935, 263),
                          sex=c("F", "F", "M", "F"),
                          age=c(23, 47, 36, 78),
                          height=c(167, 181, 178, 163),
                          weight=c(63.2, 76.9, 86.3, 57.2))
rownames(patients_df) <- c("Wilma", "Betty", "Fred", "Pebbles")
colnames(patients_df)[4] <- "height_in_cm"
patients_df[,"postcode"] <- c("2202", "3405", "2022", "2119")
```

Note the different classes of returned in the following examples.
If a single column is returned, it is as a vector.
If more than one column is returned, then it is necessarily returned as a data frame.

```{r data-frames-example-11, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="data-frames-examples-set-up-d"}
a <- patients_df[,"weight"]
class(a)
a
```

```{r data-frames-example-12, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="data-frames-examples-set-up-d"}
b <- patients_df[,c("sex", "weight")]
class(b)
b
```

There is one other way of selecting columns from a data frame,
and that is using the square brackets operator with a single argument (no comma).
In this case, one or more columns (not rows) are returned, as a data frame,
not as a bare vector, even when a single column is requested.

Compare these examples, paying close attention to whether single or double square brackets are used:

```{r data-frames-example-13, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="data-frames-examples-set-up-d"}
w <- patients_df["weight"]
class(w)
w
```

```{r data-frames-example-14, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="data-frames-examples-set-up-d"}
x <- patients_df[["weight"]]
class(x)
x
```

```{r data-frames-example-15, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="data-frames-examples-set-up-d"}
y <- patients_df[c("sex", "weight")]
class(y)
y
```

<div class="under-the-bonnet">
### Under the bonnet...

If you haven't done section 3 yet and covered lists you may safely skip this section on your first pass through
this tutorial and come back to it after reading section 3.

Recall, a data frame is a list of vectors.
This should help you understand what is going on when you use `[[ ]]`, `[ ]`, `$`, or `[..., ...]` to subset a data frame.

$$
\textrm{patients_df} \leftarrow [[ \left( \matrix{123 \\ 876 \\ 935 \\ 263} \right) \left( \matrix{\textrm{"F"} \\ \textrm{"F"} \\ \textrm{"M"} \\ \textrm{"F"}} \right) \left( \matrix{23 \\ 47 \\ 36 \\ 78} \right) \left( \matrix{167 \\ 181 \\ 178 \\163} \right) \left( \matrix{\textrm{"Wilma"} \\ \textrm{"Betty"} \\ \textrm{"Fred"} \\ \textrm{"Pebbles"}} \right) ]]
$$
</div>

## Subsetting data frames

We have seen above that a logical vector can be used to select or subset rows in a data frame.
Recall that logical comparison expressions involving a vector themselves return a logical vector (a 'mask' of `TRUE` and `FALSE` values).

Thus, we can use comparison expressions directly to subset a data frame based on the values in specific columns in that data frame.
Examine these examples:

```{r data-frames-example-16, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="data-frames-examples-set-up-d"}
# create a subset of female patients only
d <- patients_df[patients_df$sex == "F",]
d
```

```{r data-frames-example-17, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="data-frames-examples-set-up-d"}
# create a subset of patients taller than 170 cm
e <- patients_df[patients_df$height_in_cm > 170,]
e
```

```{r data-frames-example-18, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="data-frames-examples-set-up-d"}
# create a subset of female patients taller than 170 cm
f <- patients_df[patients_df$sex == "F" & patients_df$height_in_cm > 170,]
f
```

```{r data-frames-example-19, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="data-frames-examples-set-up-d"}
# create a subset of female patients taller than 170 cm or who live in postcode 2119
g <- patients_df[(patients_df$sex == "F" & patients_df$height_in_cm > 170) | patients_df$postcode == "2119",]
g
```

Note the use of `&` for logical AND and `|` for logical OR when combining logical vectors (the `!` negation operator can also be used).

It is very important to be familiar with the precedence rules for these operators:
just like unary minus is performed before multiplication and division,
and multiplication and division is always performed before addition and subtraction,
`!` negation is always performed before `&` (logical AND), and `&` is performed before `|` (logical OR).

Brackets should be used where necessary to ensure that logical,
comparison and arithmetic operations are performed in the order which you intend.

In the example above, the brackets are not actually needed,
although they do no harm and help clarify our intention that we want female patients taller than 170 cm,
or patients of any sex who live in postcode 2119.

However, the following two examples are not equivalent, as you can see from the results returned.
Ensure that you understand why the results are different.

```{r data-frames-example-20, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="data-frames-examples-set-up-d"}
h <- patients_df[(patients_df$sex == "F" | patients_df$height_in_cm > 170) & patients_df$postcode == "2119",]
h
```

```{r data-frames-example-21, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="data-frames-examples-set-up-d"}
i <- patients_df[patients_df$sex == "F" | patients_df$height_in_cm > 170 & patients_df$postcode == "2119",]
i
```

The first expression returns patients who are 'female patients taller than 170 cm or patients of any sex who live in postcode 2119'.
The second expression returns patients who are 'female patients or patients taller than 170 cm who live in postcode 2119'.

## Activity: subsetting data frames

In the code cell below, first create the `patients_df` data frame using this code:

```
patients_df <- data.frame(id=c(123, 876, 935, 263),
                          sex=c("F", "F", "M", "F"),
                          age=c(23, 47, 36, 78),
                          height=c(167, 181, 178, 163),
                          weight=c(63.2, 76.9, 86.3, 57.2))
```

Then add R code to:

  * calculate a set of Tukey's 'five numbers' summary statistics for each of the age, height and weight columns using the `fivenum()` function (read the manual page for `fivenum()` to find out what the five numbers are)
    * hint: search for 'fivenum' in the Help pane in RStudio
  * re-calculate those summary statistics for just the females
  * add a column to the data frame containing the calculated BMI (body mass index) (the formula for BMI is weight (in kilograms) divided by the height (in metres) squared
  
$$\textrm{BMI} \leftarrow \frac{\textrm{weight}}{\textrm{height} ^ 2}$$

Note that the height in the `patients_df` data frame is in centimetres, and the weight is in kilograms.
  
```{r data-frames-exercise-1, exercise=TRUE}


```

```{r data-frames-exercise-1-hint-1}
patients_df <- data.frame(id=c(123, 876, 935, 263),
                          sex=c("F", "F", "M", "F"),
                          age=c(23, 47, 36, 78),
                          height=c(167, 181, 178, 163),
                          weight=c(63.2, 76.9, 86.3, 57.2))

print("Tukey's five numbers for the age column:")
fivenum(patients_df[,"age"])

print("Tukey's five numbers for the height column:")
fivenum(patients_df[,"height"])

print("Tukey's five numbers for the weight column:")
fivenum(patients_df$weight) # referencing the weight column using the $ operator as an alternative
```

```{r data-frames-exercise-1-hint-2}
print("Tukey's five numbers for the age column for females:")
fivenum(patients_df[patients_df$sex == "F","age"])

print("Tukey's five numbers for the height column for females:")
fivenum(patients_df[patients_df$sex == "F","height"])

print("Tukey's five numbers for the weight column for females:")
# referencing the weight column using the $ operator as an alternative
fivenum(patients_df[patients_df$sex == "F",]$weight) 
```

```{r data-frames-exercise-1-hint-3}
patients_df$bmi <- patients_df$weight / (patients_df$height/100)^2
patients_df
```

## Attaching data frames and _with()_

In the code above where we were creating a subset of a data frame in `i`,
we needed to prefix each of the column names in the `patients_df` data frame with the name of the data frame itself,
so R could find the column.
This can be tedious to type and makes the code more difficult to read.

Instead, we can _attach_ the `patients_df` data frame to the local scope (the collection of names R can 'see' as variable names),
as shown in the code that follows.

Note also the use of the `identical()` function to test whether the subsetted data frames `i` and `j` are the same,
and that we _detach_ the `patients_df` data frame from the search path as soon as we have finished with it.

Detaching data frames as soon as direct reference to their column or element names is no longer need is good practice
and helps avoid confusion and mistakes,
such as when two different data frames have a column with the same name, and both are attached to the search path.
(R will only find one of them and it may not be the one you are expecting.)

```{r data-frames-examples-set-up-e}
patients_df <- data.frame(id=c(123, 876, 935, 263),
                          gender=c("F", "F", "M", "F"),
                          age=c(23, 47, 36, 78),
                          height=c(167, 181, 178, 163),
                          weight=c(63.2, 76.9, 86.3, 57.2))
rownames(patients_df) <- c("Wilma", "Betty", "Fred", "Pebbles")
colnames(patients_df)[4] <- "height_in_cm"
patients_df[,"postcode"] <- c("2202", "3405", "2022", "2119")
i <- patients_df[patients_df$gender == "F" | patients_df$height_in_cm > 170 & patients_df$postcode == "2119",]
```

```{r data-frames-example-22, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="data-frames-examples-set-up-e"}
attach(patients_df)

j <- patients_df[gender == "F" | height_in_cm > 170 & postcode == "2119",]

j

identical(i, j)

detach(patients_df)
```

### The _with()_ function

As an alternative to attaching and detaching data frames, the `with()` function can be used.

This effectively attaches a data frame, but only within the context of the `with()` function.

Thus the follow is also equivalent to the code above:

```{r data-frames-example-23, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="data-frames-examples-set-up-e"}
k <- with(patients_df, patients_df[gender == "F" | height_in_cm > 170 & postcode == "2119",])
k
identical(i, k)
```

Multiple statements can be nested inside the context of the `with()` function by using curly braces.
The resulting value of the `with()` is the value of the last line of the block of code

```{r data-frames-example-23a, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="data-frames-examples-set-up-e"}
n <- with(patients_df, {
  k <- patients_df[gender == "F" | height_in_cm > 170 & postcode == "2119",]
  nrow(k)
})
n
```

Variables created inside the block of code are not available outside the block.

```{r data-frames-example-23b, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="data-frames-examples-set-up-e"}
n <- with(patients_df, {
  k <- patients_df[gender == "F" | height_in_cm > 170 & postcode == "2119",]
  nrow(k)
})
k
```

Any changes made to their value are purely local to the block of code.

```{r data-frames-example-23c, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="data-frames-examples-set-up-e"}
k = "hello"
n <- with(patients_df, {
  k <- patients_df[gender == "F" | height_in_cm > 170 & postcode == "2119",]
  nrow(k)
})
k
```

## Combining data frames

Like matrices, data frames can be combined row-wise or column-wise using the `rbind()` and `cbind()` functions respectively:

```{r data-frames-example-24, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="data-frames-examples-set-up-e"}
# remind ourselves of the contents of patients_df
patients_df
```

```{r data-frames-example-25, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="data-frames-examples-set-up-e"}
# create an additional patients data frame
more_patients_df <- data.frame(id=c(897, 866, 35),
                          gender=c("F", "M", "F"),
                          age=c(27, 17, 56),
                          height_in_cm=c(147, 193, 174),
                          weight=c(53.7, 75.6, 93.3),
                          postcode=c(2119, 2121, 2071))
more_patients_df
```

```{r data-frames-examples-set-up-f}
patients_df <- data.frame(id=c(123, 876, 935, 263),
                          gender=c("F", "F", "M", "F"),
                          age=c(23, 47, 36, 78),
                          height=c(167, 181, 178, 163),
                          weight=c(63.2, 76.9, 86.3, 57.2))
rownames(patients_df) <- c("Wilma", "Betty", "Fred", "Pebbles")
colnames(patients_df)[4] <- "height_in_cm"
patients_df[,"postcode"] <- c("2202", "3405", "2022", "2119")
more_patients_df <- data.frame(id=c(897, 866, 35),
                          gender=c("F", "M", "F"),
                          age=c(27, 17, 56),
                          height_in_cm=c(147, 193, 174),
                          weight=c(53.7, 75.6, 93.3),
                          postcode=c(2119, 2121, 2071))
```

```{r data-frames-example-26, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="data-frames-examples-set-up-f"}
# combine row-wise
all_patients_df <- rbind(patients_df, more_patients_df)
all_patients_df
```

```{r data-frames-example-27, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="data-frames-examples-set-up-f"}
# create some additional columns for the all_patients_df data frame
all_patients_additional_columns <- data.frame(
                          systolic_bp=c(123, 145, 90, 162, 150, 115, 110),
                          diastolic_bp=c(85, 90, 60, 75, 100, 70, 50))
all_patients_additional_columns
```

```{r data-frames-examples-set-up-g}
patients_df <- data.frame(id=c(123, 876, 935, 263),
                          gender=c("F", "F", "M", "F"),
                          age=c(23, 47, 36, 78),
                          height=c(167, 181, 178, 163),
                          weight=c(63.2, 76.9, 86.3, 57.2))
rownames(patients_df) <- c("Wilma", "Betty", "Fred", "Pebbles")
colnames(patients_df)[4] <- "height_in_cm"
patients_df[,"postcode"] <- c("2202", "3405", "2022", "2119")
more_patients_df <- data.frame(id=c(897, 866, 35),
                          gender=c("F", "M", "F"),
                          age=c(27, 17, 56),
                          height_in_cm=c(147, 193, 174),
                          weight=c(53.7, 75.6, 93.3),
                          postcode=c(2119, 2121, 2071))
all_patients_df <- rbind(patients_df, more_patients_df)
all_patients_additional_columns <- data.frame(
                          systolic_bp=c(123, 145, 90, 162, 150, 115, 110),
                          diastolic_bp=c(85, 90, 60, 75, 100, 70, 50))
```

```{r data-frames-example-28, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="data-frames-examples-set-up-g"}
# combine column-wise
all_patients_df_with_bp <- cbind(all_patients_df, all_patients_additional_columns)
all_patients_df_with_bp
```

Of course,
combining data column-wise in this fashion presumes that the rows of data in the data frames being combined are in the correct order.
This is not always the case.

Often our data frames contain a unique key column that identifies records belonging to the same individual or entity.

When this id is shared between different data frames
it is possible to join or merge data frames on the basis of the unique key column
to identify records belonging to the same individual or entity in the data frames being merged.

Examine this example:

```{r data-frames-examples-set-up-h}
patients_df <- data.frame(id=c(123, 876, 935, 263),
                          gender=c("F", "F", "M", "F"),
                          age=c(23, 47, 36, 78),
                          height=c(167, 181, 178, 163),
                          weight=c(63.2, 76.9, 86.3, 57.2))
rownames(patients_df) <- c("Wilma", "Betty", "Fred", "Pebbles")
colnames(patients_df)[4] <- "height_in_cm"
patients_df[,"postcode"] <- c("2202", "3405", "2022", "2119")
more_patients_df <- data.frame(id=c(897, 866, 35),
                          gender=c("F", "M", "F"),
                          age=c(27, 17, 56),
                          height_in_cm=c(147, 193, 174),
                          weight=c(53.7, 75.6, 93.3),
                          postcode=c(2119, 2121, 2071))
all_patients_df <- rbind(patients_df, more_patients_df)
all_patients_additional_columns <- data.frame(
                          systolic_bp=c(123, 145, 90, 162, 150, 115, 110),
                          diastolic_bp=c(85, 90, 60, 75, 100, 70, 50))
all_patients_df_with_bp <- cbind(all_patients_df, all_patients_additional_columns)
```

```{r data-frames-example-29, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="data-frames-examples-set-up-h"}
pulse_rates <- data.frame(
                          id=c(866, 123, 897, 35, 876),
                          pulse_rate=c(72, 91, 62, 77, 103))
pulse_rates

# merge by id column value
merged_patients_df <- merge(all_patients_df_with_bp, pulse_rates, by="id", all=TRUE)
merged_patients_df
```

Even though the rows are in a different order in the two data frames,
the `id` column lets us match up rows corresponding to the same individual.
Where a `pulse_rate` is not available a value of `NA` has been added by the merge.

## Activity: merging data frames

Write R code to create a new data frame with an `id` column containing ID numbers
that match some of the ID numbers in the `patients_df` data frame you created previously.
The new data frame should also contain at least one other column,
containing data about some other characteristic of some of the patients.
However, your new data frame should have fewer rows than the `patients_df` data frame.
That is, it should not contain data for all the patients in `patients_df`, only for some of them.
It will have fewer rows.

Use the `merge()` function to merge (join) your new data frame to the `patients_df` data frame,
and print the resulting data frame.

We have pre-populated the code cell below with code that creates the `patients_df` data frame. Add your code after that.

```{r data-frames-exercise-2, exercise=TRUE}
patients_df <- data.frame(id=c(123, 876, 935, 263),
                          gender=c("F", "F", "M", "F"),
                          age=c(23, 47, 36, 78),
                          height=c(167, 181, 178, 163),
                          weight=c(63.2, 76.9, 86.3, 57.2))


```

```{r data-frames-exercise-2-solution}
patients_df <- data.frame(id=c(123, 876, 935, 263),
                          gender=c("F", "F", "M", "F"),
                          age=c(23, 47, 36, 78),
                          height=c(167, 181, 178, 163),
                          weight=c(63.2, 76.9, 86.3, 57.2))

shoe_sizes <- data.frame(id=c(876, 263),
                         shoe_size=c(11,9))

patients_df2 <- merge(patients_df, shoe_sizes, by='id', all=TRUE)
patients_df2
```

## Sorting data frames

Recall that we used the `order()` function, which returns a sorted index vector, to create a sorted version of a data vector.

We can also use it to create sorted versions of a data frame.
Let's sort our `merged_patients_df` data frame by age:

```{r data-frames-examples-set-up-i}
patients_df <- data.frame(id=c(123, 876, 935, 263),
                          gender=c("F", "F", "M", "F"),
                          age=c(23, 47, 36, 78),
                          height=c(167, 181, 178, 163),
                          weight=c(63.2, 76.9, 86.3, 57.2))
rownames(patients_df) <- c("Wilma", "Betty", "Fred", "Pebbles")
colnames(patients_df)[4] <- "height_in_cm"
patients_df[,"postcode"] <- c("2202", "3405", "2022", "2119")
more_patients_df <- data.frame(id=c(897, 866, 35),
                          gender=c("F", "M", "F"),
                          age=c(27, 17, 56),
                          height_in_cm=c(147, 193, 174),
                          weight=c(53.7, 75.6, 93.3),
                          postcode=c(2119, 2121, 2071))
all_patients_df <- rbind(patients_df, more_patients_df)
all_patients_additional_columns <- data.frame(
                          systolic_bp=c(123, 145, 90, 162, 150, 115, 110),
                          diastolic_bp=c(85, 90, 60, 75, 100, 70, 50))
all_patients_df_with_bp <- cbind(all_patients_df, all_patients_additional_columns)
pulse_rates <- data.frame(
                          id=c(866, 123, 897, 35, 876),
                          pulse_rate=c(72, 91, 62, 77, 103))
merged_patients_df <- merge(all_patients_df_with_bp, pulse_rates, by="id", all=TRUE)
```

```{r data-frames-example-30, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="data-frames-examples-set-up-i"}
t <- merged_patients_df[order(merged_patients_df$age),]
t
```

We can sort by two or more columns if required.
Note the use of `with()` here to avoid having to type the name of the data frame repeatedly to identify the column names.

```{r data-frames-example-31, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="data-frames-examples-set-up-i"}
s <- with(merged_patients_df, merged_patients_df[order(gender, height_in_cm),])
s
```

## Reading data into data frames

So far we have constructed data frames 'manually' in code.
But of course R can load or import existing data from a wide variety of sources and formats,
including reading data directly from databases,
from file formats used by other statistics and analysis software such as the SAS System, SPSS, Stata, Minitab,
and even directly from Microsoft Excel,
as well as directly from resources on the internet.

However, perhaps the most common way of getting external data into R is by importing a CSV (comma separated value) file.
The CSV file format is very commonly used to exchange or share data between different systems or programs.

Creating a data frame from a CSV file is very easy, using the `read.csv()` function. 

Here we will read a CSV file directly from a web server on the internet,
but of course you can also read CSV files that are stored in your computer's local file system
_e.g._ on the hard disc or a network drive.

```{r read-csv-example-1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.timelimit=3600}
acifile = "https://data.gov.au/dataset/05696f6f-6ff5-42a2-904f-af5e4d1f56f8/resource/7fbac314-4bf9-4601-b812-0307316ef5a4/download/acimcombinedcounts.csv"
aci <- read.csv(acifile)

# if direct internet download fails, comment out the lines above and
# then uncomment the following two lines and re-run
# acifile <- system.file("extdata", "acimcombinedcounts.csv", package="cbdrh.rintro")
# aci <- read.csv(acifile))

str(aci)
```

```{r read-csv-example-set-up-a}
acifile = "https://data.gov.au/dataset/05696f6f-6ff5-42a2-904f-af5e4d1f56f8/resource/7fbac314-4bf9-4601-b812-0307316ef5a4/download/acimcombinedcounts.csv"
aci <- read.csv(acifile)
if (nrow(aci) != 9240) {
  acifile <- system.file("extdata", "acimcombinedcounts.csv", package="cbdrh.rintro")
  aci <- read.csv(acifile)  
}  
#save(aci, file=path.expand("~/intro-to-R/aci.Rda"))
```


```{r read-csv-example-2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="read-csv-example-set-up-a"}
nrow(aci) # returns number of rows in a data frame

colnames(aci) # column names

# examine the first few rows of the data frame from 1982 onwards
# note the use of the head() function for this
head(aci[aci$Year >= 1982,])

# examine the last few rows for lung cancer
# note the use of the tail function
tail(aci[aci$Year >= 1982 & aci$Cancer_Type == "Lung cancer",])
```

Notice that by default, the `read.csv()` function will automatically convert character columns into factors.
There is an argument to stop this if you wish,
because not all character columns are categorical,
_e.g._ if they contain, say, a free text comment.


```{r read-csv-example-7, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="read-csv-example-set-up-a"}
aci2 <- read.csv(acifile,
                 stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

class(aci2$Sex)
```

## Activity: reading CSV files

Find a CSV file that is freely available on the internet, or on your computer,
and read it into an R data frame using the `read.csv()` function.
The CSV file will need to be directly accessible at a URL, without the need to enter a password
(R can download files from password-protected websites and even negotiate complex web page interfaces,
but exploring those capabilities is beyond the scope of this tutorial).

There are a large number of suitable CSV files available via the NSW government Open Data website
at https://data.nsw.gov.au/data/dataset but feel free to use other sites.

Use the `str()` function to show the structure of the data frame you create,
and the `head()` and `tail()` functions to show the top and bottom rows of the data frame.

```{r read-csv-exercise-1, exercise=TRUE}


```


```{r read-csv-exercise-1-solution}
nsw_schools <- read.csv("https://data.cese.nsw.gov.au/data/dataset/027493b2-33ad-3f5b-8ed9-37cdca2b8650/resource/2ac19870-44f6-443d-a0c3-4c867f04c305/download/collections.csv")

str(nsw_schools)

head(nsw_schools)

tail(nsw_schools)
```

## Summary

This concludes section 4 and our overview of data frames (and the factor data type).

In section 5 we will look at writing functions in R.
