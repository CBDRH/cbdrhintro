## Writing functions in R

We have already mentioned that R is a highly functional language,
in the sense that almost everything is done by calling functions that operate on arguments passed to them.

A key feature of R is the ability to write new functions and to use these
just as one might use functions that are built into the core of the R language.

Writing functions lets us avoid all the problems of repeating program code over and over,
sometimes with only minor changes, in order to carry out repeated actions.

Such code repetition, usually achieved by cutting-and-pasting existing code, then changing one small part of it,
is a very bad practice and leads to programs that are very hard to read, debug and maintain.

You should get into the habit of always writing R code as functions.
Code that is written as a function is much easier to reuse somewhere else.
The processing of writing a function helps clarify thinking about what is fixed behaviour and what is parametric behaviour.

You can write functions too, even if the code is not used in multiple places.
Breaking large pages of code up into smaller named chunks of code (functions are just named chunks of code)
can make programmes more readable when we choose sensible function names which describe what the code in the function does.

Also, a block of code should almost never run to more than a page or a screenful of code.
Code chunks that are that big are hard to read and follow.
Break them up in to smaller chunks by using functions.

### Function syntax

The basic syntax for creating a function in R is very simple.
Let's create a function that calculates the _Body Mass Index_ (also known as _BMI_ or the _Quetelet index_).

As noted in previous exercise instructions,
the BMI of a person is defined as their weight in kilograms divided by the square of their height in metres.

$$\textrm{BMI} \leftarrow \frac{\textrm{weight}}{\textrm{height} ^ 2}$$

```{r functions-example-1, exercise=TRUE}
wt <- 78.5 # weight in kilograms
ht <- 1.75 # height in metres
bmi <- wt / ht^2
bmi
```

To calculate the BMI for another patient, we would need to repeat the code for the BMI calculation:

```{r functions-example-2, exercise=TRUE}
wt <- 82.9 # weight in kilograms
ht <- 1.53 # height in metres
bmi <- wt / ht^2
bmi
```

Let's create a function to do the BMI calculation instead:

```{r functions-example-3, exercise=TRUE}
bmi <- function(wt, ht) {
    bmi <- wt / ht^2
    return(bmi)
}

# check what class bmi is
class(bmi)

# if we just print the function itself, R shows us the source code
bmi
```

```{r functions-examples-set-up-a}
bmi <- function(wt, ht) {
    bmi <- wt / ht^2
    return(bmi)
}
```

Now we can use, and re-use, over and over, our own new `bmi()` function:

```{r functions-example-4, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="functions-examples-set-up-a"}
wt <- 78.5 # weight in kilograms
ht <- 1.75 # height in metres
bmi(wt, ht)
```

Note that the `bmi` object has a class of "function", and that it can manipulated like any other R object, such as storing it in a list.

If you look clearly at the function declaration syntax we are just using `<-` to assign a function `function(wt, ht) { ... }` to a name `bmi`.
It's just a normal assignment operation with a new type of value, a _function object_.

Most modern languages handle functions like this because it allows them to be passed around.
When we can pass functions around we can use them to control how things behave.
For example, we can pass a function to a sorting routine to define what it means
for one thing to come 'before' another and thus control sorting.
In fact, we've already seen something like this when we passed a block of code into the `with()` statement to be executed.

We describe this as 'functions being first-class objects', in other words
we can pass them around and put them in variables like the number `5` or the string `"hello"`.
Not all languages are like this.
In languages such as SAS, functions are not first-class objects and this can limit what one can do,
or at least make some things a lot harder.

### Returning values from functions

It is not strictly necessary to use the `return()` function to specify what is to be returned by a function.
If there is no explicit `return()` inside a function definition,
R will just return the value given by the last line in the function definition.

Thus, we could have written our bmi() functions as follows:

```
bmi2 <- function(wt, ht) {
    bmi <- wt / ht^2
    bmi
}
```

or even as

```
bmi3 <- function(wt, ht) {
    wt / ht^2
}
```

or you might even see code written like this, without the curly braces, since the body of the function has only one line:

```
bmi4 <- function(wt, ht) wt / ht^2
```

In practice though, one would not write code like the last example because it starts to become unreadble and a great
principle to follow when programming is `clarity not brevity`. 

Let's check that all those versions of our function give the same answer:

```{r functions-example-6, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=23}
bmi <- function(wt, ht) {
    bmi <- wt / ht^2
    return(bmi)
}

bmi2 <- function(wt, ht) {
    bmi <- wt / ht^2
    bmi
}

bmi3 <- function(wt, ht) {
    wt / ht^2
}

bmi4 <- function(wt, ht) wt / ht^2

ht <- 1.96
wt <- 93.7
bmi(wt, ht)
bmi2(wt, ht)
bmi3(wt, ht)
bmi4(wt, ht)
```

The arguments passed to a function can be any R object,
including vectors, matrices, lists, data frames or even other functions,
and similarly the value returned from a function can be any type of R object.

Does our `bmi()` function work when it is passed vectors of many heights and weights?

```{r functions-example-7, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="functions-examples-set-up-a"}
wts <- c(82.9, 78.5, 52.1)
hts <- c(1.96, 1.75, 1.53)
bmis <- bmi(wts, hts)
bmis
```

So yes, it does! Our `bmi()` function works fine with vectors of values and performs calculations element-wise on the vectors.
If you think about the expression the `bmi()` function is actually evaluating

```
wt / ht^2
```

then this is what we would expect since `ht^2` returns a vector with everything in `ht` squared
and `wt / x` divides in the elements of `wt` by the elements of `x` element-by-element.
Here `x` is `ht^2`.
(Remember operator precedence means the `^` is being evaluated before the `/`.)

## Activity: define a function

Write a function to calculate the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) from the systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressures. 

Use the following formula to estimate MAP:

$$ \textrm{MAP} \leftarrow DBP + \frac{\textrm{SBP} - \textrm{DBP}}{3} $$

Demonstrate the use of your function using some typical blood pressure readings.

```{r functions-exercise-1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=6}


```

```{r functions-exercise-1-solution}
map <- function(sbp, dbp) {
    map <- dbp + ((sbp - dbp)/3)
    return(map)
}

map(125, 80)
map(150, 90)
```

Note that R will only return a single expression or object from a function.
This is different to some programming languages, which can return many expressions or objects from a function.

If you need to return several values or objects of different types from an R function,
or if you need to return multiple vectors as a result of calculations,
you can just add those objects to a list object (or a data frame) and return that list or data frame object.

Remember, you can name the elements of a vector or list returned from a function to make it easier to use in the calling code.

For example, imagine that we wanted a function that returned the argument passed to it,
raised to the first, second, third, fourth and fifth powers.
The argument passed in is a vector so we will be returning multiple vectors, five vectors in fact.
We will need to use a list to hold our five vectors.

We could write our function like this:

```{r functions-example-8, exercise=TRUE}
five_powers <- function(x) {
    # create a list with 5 empty elements in it
    result <- list(5)
    result[[1]] <- x
    result[[2]] <- x^2
    result[[3]] <- x^3
    result[[4]] <- x^4
    result[[5]] <- x^5
    return(result)
}

# test our function
z <- five_powers(3)

class(z)
z
```

There's still a lot of code repetition here which we would normally remove and we'll look at ways of doing that in the final section.
But, for the purposes of this example, it's very clear what we're doing: creating a list of 5 values and returning it.

## Named arguments

So far, we have created a `bmi()` function whose arguments, `weight` and `height`, are passed by position.

That is,
the first argument passed to the function when it is called is taken to be the `weight` argument,
and the second argument passed when the function is called is taken to be the `height` argument.

The arguments in the function definition are matched up with the arguments when the function is called in the order they are given.
This means that if we pass the arguments to the function in the wrong order, we will get the wrong answer.
If we swap weight and height in our `bmi()` function or the systolic and diastolic pressures in our `map()` function, R has no way of knowing.

```{r functions-example-9, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="functions-examples-set-up-a"}
bmi(82.9, 1.96) # arguments in correct order

bmi(1.96, 82.9) # arguments in incorrect order!
```

However, it is also possible to define functions with named arguments,
which can be very helpful in avoiding such errors,
particularly if the function takes a large number of arguments.
A named argument is defined by specifying the name followed by `=` followed by a default value for that argument.
For example:

```
named_bmi <- function(wt=NA, ht=NA) {
    return(wt / ht^2)
}
```

Now, it doesn't matter which way around we pass the named arguments to our function:

```{r functions-example-10, exercise=TRUE}
named_bmi <- function(wt=NA, ht=NA) {
    return(wt / ht^2)
}

named_bmi(wt=82.9, ht=1.96)

named_bmi(ht=1.96, wt=82.9)
```

Named function arguments must be specified with a default value (which can be just `NA` or `NULL`).
If you don't specify a named argument that has been defined for a function when calling that function,
then the function will just use the default value for that argument.

This returns `NA` because the default value for the `wt=` argument is `NA`:

```{r functions-examples-set-up-c}
named_bmi <- function(wt=NA, ht=NA) {
    return(wt / ht^2)
}
```

```{r functions-example-11, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="functions-examples-set-up-c"}
named_bmi(ht=82.9)
```

Note that named arguments can still be passed to a function as unnamed positional arguments.
This example, courtesy of [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org) illustrates the way in which this works:

```{r functions-example-12, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=30}
# define a function with three named arguments, that just prints out the values of those arguments
display <- function(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3) {
  result <- c(a, b, c)
  names(result) <- c("a", "b", "c")  # This names each element of the vector
  return(result)
}

print("call it with no arguments")
display()

print("one positional argument")
display(55)

print("two positional arguments")
display(55, 66)

print("three positional arguments")
display(55, 66, 77)

print("only setting the value of c")
display(c = 77)

# these last two examples are legal but bad practice because they are confusing rather than clarifying
# the behaviour of code should be clear and unambiguous to the reader

print("mixing positional and named arguments")
display(a = 55, 66, c = 77)

# even this works correctly because named arguments are matched before positional arguments
display(66, a = 55, c = 77)
```

R will also do partial matching on argument names, provided it is unambiguous. Consider:

```{r functions-example-13, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=20}
# define a function with three named arguments, that just prints out the values of those arguments
longarg_display <- function(a = 1, b = 2, long_named_argument = 3, long_nosed_argument = 4) {
  result <- c(a, b, long_named_argument, long_nosed_argument)
  # This names each element of the vector
  names(result) <- c("a", "b", "long_named_argument", "long_nosed_argument")  
  return(result)
}

# no arguments passed, just uses defaults
longarg_display()

# partial matching on named arguments
longarg_display(long_na=79)

# partial matching on named arguments
longarg_display(long_no=89)

# but partial matching must be unambiguous
# uncomment the following line and re-run the code
# longarg_display(long_n=59)
```

<div class="aside">
### An aside...

Partial name matching also works with named elements in lists and data frames.
You can also use partial name matching when working with lists that have named elements,
and with data frames (in which the columns behave like named elements in a list).
For example:

```{r functions-example-14, exercise=TRUE}
patients_df <- data.frame(id=c(123, 876, 935, 263),
                          sex=c("F", "F", "M","F"),
                          age=c(23, 47, 36, 78),
                          height=c(167, 181, 178, 163),
                          weight=c(63.2, 76.9, 86.3, 57.2))

heights <- patients_df$he
heights
```

It is fine to use such partial name matching when using R interactively,
but **it is not good practice to use partial name matching in written programs.**
Its use may introduce errors unexpectedly.

Consider if we later added a new column called `health_status` to our `patients_df` data frame, above.

The line:

```
heights <- patients_df$he
```

would now throw an error due to ambiguity problems. It is better to avoid such situations by using full names in written program code.

## Wrapper functions

### The `...` (ellipsis) argument

There is one other type of argument that can be passed to a function: the `...` (ellipsis) argument.

This is used when the exact number of arguments for a function is not known in advance.

Consider a function like `c()` or `paste()`.
Both of these functions take a variable number of values (at least one) and combine them into a vector (in the case of `c()`)
or a character string (in the case of `paste()`).

The number of values that they take as arguments is not known or fixed in advance,
and thus they use the `...` argument type to accommodate this.

If you examine the manual page for the `c()` function, you will see that its syntax is described as `c(...)`

The ellipsis argument type is also useful when you are writing functions
that 'wrap' other functions in order to customise or modify their behaviour.

Rather than having to explicitly list all the arguments required by the function that is being wrapped,
once can just use the `...` argument as a placeholder for all those arguments.
An example will help make this clearer.

Let's consider the `hist()` function that creates a histogram chart from data passed to it:

```{r functions-example-15, exercise=TRUE}
# make sure we get repeatable behaviour from the random number generator
set.seed(1234)

# create a vector of 1000 random numbers with a Normal distribution 

x <- rnorm(1000) 

# create a histogram of these data
hist(x)
```

The `hist()` function takes a large number of optional arguments used to set all sorts of attributes of the chart produced.

Imagine we wanted to create a customised version of the `hist()` function that always made the histogram bars blue.
We could write our customised histogram function like this:

```{r functions-examples-set-up-d}
set.seed(1234)
x <- rnorm(1000) 
blue_hist <- function(data) {
    hist(data, col="blue")
}
```

```{r functions-example-16, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="functions-examples-set-up-d"}
blue_hist <- function(data) {
    hist(data, col="blue")
}

blue_hist(x)
```

But what if we want to override the x-axis label so that it says 'a Normal random variate'?

This won't work, because we haven't specified an `xlab` argument in the definition of our `blue_hist()` function:

```{r functions-example-17, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="functions-examples-set-up-d"}
blue_hist(x, xlab="a Normal random variate")
```
But if we include the ellipsis argument as one of the arguments to our `blue_hist()` function, it works!

The `xlab` argument, and any other argument we pass to our `blue_hist()` function,
are passed through to body of the function (the interior scope, see next section),
and from there to any other ellipsis arguments used inside the function.

```{r functions-example-18, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="functions-examples-set-up-d"}
blue_hist <- function(data, ...) {
    hist(data, col="blue", ...)
}

blue_hist(x, xlab="a Normal random variate")
```

This gives us a mechanism to pass on any number of extra arugments without having to know what they are
and explicitly list them.
It saves a lot of work now and later: if the `hist()` function gets a new argument to control something new
we don't need to change our code.

### Exercise

Write a function that is a wrapper around the `hist()` function that sets the default number of histogram bins to 80.
Demonstrate its use with a vector of 1000 Normal random variates, as used in the examples above.

Hint: the `breaks=` argument to the `hist()` function sets the number of bins if given an integer value.

```{r functions-exercise-2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=10}


```

```{r functions-exercise-2-solution}
hist80bins <- function(x, breaks=80, ...) {
    hist(x, breaks=80, ...)
}

z <- rnorm(1000)

hist80bins(z, main="An 80-binned histogram")
```

## Scoping in R

A detailed discussion of environments (in the R sense) and scoping is too large for this tutorial,
but some basic understanding of the scoping rules in R is essential.

_Scope_ refers to the extent to which a name (like a variable or function name) and its association with a particular value
may be relied on within code.
We saw a glimpse of this when we looked at the `with()` function.
A full discussion of _scope_ in the computer science sense
can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(computer_science)).

For example, if we bind the name `a` to an integer vector `c(1, 2, 3)`,
then the scope of `a` is all the environments in R in which the name `a` points to that particular vector object.

What do we mean by an `environment`?

An environment can be thought of as a small world, in which objects live, and in which names are bound to those objects.

When we write code in R, it mostly runs in what is called the global environment.

When we define a new object and bind it to a name, _e.g._ `a <- c(1, 2, 3)`,
then that integer vector value `c(1, 2, 3)` lives in the global environment
and is visible to and can be referenced (used) by other objects in the global environment by the name `a`.

Whenever we call a function in R, a new environment is created in which that function then runs.

All objects created inside this new environment,
and all names bound to those objects, are visible and thus can be referenced _only within that environment,_
which exists only for the duration of the one specific function call.
A new environment is created _each time a function is called_.

Objects/name bindings in the parent environment _at the point at which the function was defined_ (note **not** where it is called)
are visible and can be referenced within the new environment.
This behaviour is known as _lexical scoping_.

The new environment associated with a function call lasts only as long as that function call is running.

Thus, when your code runs, new environments are popping into existence and then disappearing all the time.
Depending on how many function calls 'deep' your programme is executing at there may be one, two or many enviroments
which have all been created one after another as your code calls function within function as a _stack_ of enviroments:
a new environment is pushed onto the stop of the stack when a function is entered and popped off the stack when the function finishes.

At this stage you may be completely confused, but some examples may help to clarify these concepts.

First, let's define a few objects in the top-level global environment (which is where all objects are created by default):

```{r functions-example-19, exercise=TRUE}
k <- c(1, 2, 3)
k
m <- c("hello", "world")
m
n <- sqrt(2:4)
n
```

```{r functions-examples-set-up-e}
k <- c(1, 2, 3)
m <- c("hello", "world")
n <- sqrt(2:4)
square <- function(w) {
    k <- w * w
    return(k)
}
```

OK, now let's write a function that returns the square(s) of its argument,
and uses an object which is also called `k` to hold the result of its internal computation:

```{r functions-example-20, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="functions-examples-set-up-e"}
square <- function(w) {
    k <- w * w
    return(k)
}
```

If we call this function, it returns the squares of the value(s) passed to it, as expected:

```{r functions-example-21a, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="functions-examples-set-up-e"}
n
z <- square(n)
z
```

So now what is the value of `k`?

Recall that we used an object called `k` inside our `square()` function to hold the result of squaring the values passed to that function.
But that `k` is completely separate to the `k` holding `c(1, 2, 3)` because it is in a different scope.
It is inside the function not at global scope.

Inside the function the binding between `k` and `c(1, 2, 3)` is temporarily forgotten
and a new binding between `k` and the result `w * w` created.
When our function finishes this binding is forgotten and the original one is visible again.

The value of `k` is unchanged from when we originally assigned it as `c(1, 2, 3)`.

```{r functions-examples-set-up-f}
k <- c(1, 2, 3)
m <- c("hello", "world")
n <- sqrt(2:4)
square <- function(w) {
    k <- w * w
    return(k)
}
z <- square(n)
```

```{r functions-example-21b, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="functions-examples-set-up-f"}
k
```

The `k` binding defined inside the `square()` function is different to the `k` binding we defined originally, in the global environment.

So, we can have more than one object with the same name, provided they exist in different environments.

The result of this is that objects and the names assigned to then are private to the function call in which they are created.

That means that you can freely use object names inside the functions you write,
without having to worry about inadvertently overwriting the values of objects
with the same name in the global environment (or whatever environment your function is called from).

This is exactly what we want because it lets us write functions without having to worry about clashes.
Imagine if we didn't have scoping:
all your variable names would have to be different from each other not only throughout your entire programme
but also with respect to every library you use and they would all have to be different to one another even from
libraries which haven't been written yet!
(It's hard to imagine but programming languages used to be like this. It's a good thing it's no longer like that)

So, we have established that the `k` defined inside our `square()` function is different from the `k` defined in the global environment.

But what names and objects _can_ be referenced inside our `square()` function?

Let's print out, from inside the `square()` function while it is running, the values of all the variables we have recently defined.

First we need to slightly extend our `square()` function to do this:

```{r functions-example-22, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=20}
square <- function(w) {
    k <- w * w
    # now print out the values of variables
    print("The value of w is:")
    print(w)

    print("The value of k is:")
    print(k)

    print("The value of m is:")
    print(m)

    print("The value of n is:")
    print(n)

    # now return the value of k from within the function    
    return(k)
}
```

Now let's run our function again:

```{r functions-examples-set-up-g}
k <- c(1, 2, 3)
m <- c("hello", "world")
n <- sqrt(2:4)
square <- function(w) {
    k <- w * w
    # now print out the values of variables
    print("The value of w is:")
    print(w)

    print("The value of k is:")
    print(k)

    print("The value of m is:")
    print(m)

    print("The value of n is:")
    print(n)

    # now return the value of k from within the function    
    return(k)
}
```

```{r functions-example-23, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="functions-examples-set-up-g"}
z <- square(n)
```

So, we can reference variables defined in the global environment from inside our function.

This can be handy, because it means we do not have to pass in every value we might need in our function to the function as an argument.
We can use global constants and data frames and vectors.

However, we cannot modify these objects which were defined outside our function from inside our function.
That's a good thing!

```{r functions-example-24, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="functions-examples-set-up-g", exercise.lines=20}
m <- c("hello", "world")
       
square <- function(w) {
    k <- w * w

    q <- c('from','inside', 'the', 'square', 'function')
    m <- c(m, q)
    print('The value of m inside the function is:')
    print(m)

    return(k)
}

z <- square(n)

print('The value of m outside the function is:')
print(m)
```

Thus, the key scoping rules to remember are:

  * code in the body of a function can reference the value of objects which are visible in the environment at the point at which the function was defined
  * by 'defined,' we mean where the code which defines the function is run, not where that code was written, _i.e._ where the 'f <- function(...) { ... }` statement is executed. It's a subtle but important distinction. Mostly you will define your own functions in the global environment (at least until you start to write your own R packages).
  * objects defined outside a function cannot be modified from within a function.

## Passing functions to other functions

As already mentioned,
functions are first-class objects in R which means one can pass a function as the argument to another function.

Consider the built-in function `aggregate()`.

You can read its manual page for full details, but in essence `aggregate()` takes a data frame,
divides the rows of data in that data frame into disjoint sets (non-overlapping parts)
based on the contents of data specified in the `by` argument,
and then applies a function passed to `aggregate()` in the `FUN` argument.

First, recall the contents of the `patients_df` data frame which we used above:

```{r functions-example-25, exercise=TRUE}
patients_df <- data.frame(id=c(123, 876, 935, 263),
                          sex=c("F", "F", "M","F"),
                          age=c(23, 47, 36, 78),
                          height=c(167, 181, 178, 163),
                          weight=c(63.2, 76.9, 86.3, 57.2))
patients_df
```

Let's use `aggregate()` to calculate the mean age, height and weight for each sex.

We can do this by passing the `mean()` function as the `FUN` argument to `aggregate()`:

```{r functions-examples-set-up-j}
patients_df <- data.frame(id=c(123, 876, 935, 263),
                          sex=c("F", "F", "M","F"),
                          age=c(23, 47, 36, 78),
                          height=c(167, 181, 178, 163),
                          weight=c(63.2, 76.9, 86.3, 57.2))
```

```{r functions-example-26, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="functions-examples-set-up-j"}
# select just our numeric columns and calculate their means
aggregate(patients_df[,c("age", "height", "weight")], list(sex=patients_df$sex), mean)
```

We can just as easily pass some function other than `mean()`, say, `min()`:

```{r functions-example-27, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="functions-examples-set-up-j"}
aggregate(patients_df[,c("age", "height", "weight")], list(sex=patients_df$sex), min)
```

or `max()`:

```{r functions-example-28, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="functions-examples-set-up-j"}
aggregate(patients_df[,c("age", "height", "weight")], list(sex=patients_df$sex), max)
```

Notice that when we do this we are not _calling_ the function so there are no `()` after the function name.
We are passing the function (without executing it) into another function.
It would nearly always be an error for `()` to appear here because then the function would get evaluated and the _result_ of the
function would get passed into `aggregate()`.
Calling `mean()` without an argument would give an error.

```{r functions-example-28a, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="functions-examples-set-up-j"}
aggregate(patients_df[,c("age", "height", "weight")], list(sex=patients_df$sex), mean())
```

Calling `sum()` without an argument would return `0` which would then be passed into `aggregate()`
which would then try to _call_ `0` as if it were a function (which obviously it can't do) and it would give an error.
In fact, `aggregate()` detects that we're trying to pass in something that isn't a function and will tell us.

```{r functions-example-28b, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="functions-examples-set-up-j"}
aggregate(patients_df[,c("age", "height", "weight")], list(sex=patients_df$sex), sum())
```

One of the most common uses of passing functions to another function is with the _apply_ class of functions:

  * `lapply()`: Loop over a list and evaluate a function on each element
  * `sapply()`: Same as `lapply()` but try to simplify the result
  * `apply()`: Apply a function over the margins of an array
  * `tapply()`: Apply a function over subsets of a vector
  * `mapply()`: Multivariate version of `lapply()`

Let's create a list `l` which contains four numeric vectors, `a` to `d`,
each of which contains 20 random numbers with a Normal distribution, and then calculate the mean of each of those vectors.

(Because we have named the elements of our list here we'll see `$a`, `$b`, _etc._ when we print out `l`
rather than `[[1]]`, `[[2]]`, _etc._.)

```{r functions-example-29, exercise=TRUE}
set.seed(1234)
# create a list
vec_len <- 20
l <- list(a=rnorm(vec_len, 1), b=rnorm(vec_len, 2), c=rnorm(vec_len, 5), d=rnorm(vec_len, 10))
l
```

```{r functions-examples-set-up-k}
set.seed(1234)
vec_len <- 20
l <- list(a=rnorm(vec_len, 1), b=rnorm(vec_len, 2), c=rnorm(vec_len, 5), d=rnorm(vec_len, 10))
```

```{r functions-example-30, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="functions-examples-set-up-k"}
# use lapply() to find the mean of each vector
m <- lapply(l, mean)
m
```

This works with functions we write ourselves, of course.

Let's write our own function that returns the mean of just the interquartile range (that is, a trimmed mean).

```{r functions-example-31, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="functions-examples-set-up-k"}
mean_iqr <- function(x) {
    quartiles <- quantile(x, probs=c(0.25, 0.75))
    y <- x[x >= quartiles[1] & x <= quartiles[2]]
    return(mean(y))
}

n <- lapply(l, mean_iqr)
n
```

Because functions are things we can create and pass around we don't always need to give them a name
(although usually this is a good idea because it can help make our intent much clearer).

We can use anonymous (also called _lambda_) functions. Note here the function being passed to `lapply()` hasn't been given a name
and then passed in, we just define a function in place.

```{r functions-example-32, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="functions-examples-set-up-k"}
n <- lapply(l, function(x) {
    quartiles <- quantile(x, probs=c(0.25, 0.75))
    y <- x[x >= quartiles[1] & x <= quartiles[2]]
    return(mean(y))
})

n
```

A detailed exploration of the other _apply_ functions is beyond the scope of these notes,
but such an exploration can be found in the chapter on
Loop Functions in Roger Peng's excellent online text [_R Programming for Data Science_](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/).

### Exercise: use the `sapply()` function

Write some R code that demonstrates the use of the `sapply()` function.
`sapply()` is like `lapply()` but returns a vector (or matrix) if the result can be simplifed as such.

```{r functions-exercise-3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=20}



```

```{r functions-exercise-3-solution}
# create a list
vec_len <- 20
l <- list(a=rnorm(vec_len, 1), b=rnorm(vec_len, 2), c=rnorm(vec_len, 5), d=rnorm(vec_len, 10))

# define a function to pass to sapply()
mean_iqr <- function(x) {
    quartiles <- quantile(x, probs=c(0.25, 0.75))
    y <- x[x >= quartiles[1] & x <= quartiles[2]]
    return(mean(y))
}

# call sapply()
n <- sapply(l, mean_iqr)

n
class(n)
```

## Summary

This concludes section 5 and our overview of functions.

In the final section, section 6, we will look at some control structures in R.
