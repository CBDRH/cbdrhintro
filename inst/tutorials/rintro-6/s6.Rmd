## Control structures in R

R has control structures very similar to those in other common C-like programming languages such as Python, C, C++, Java and JavaScript.

Control structures are used to control the execution of code in the program
in accordance with decisions which can often be made only at runtime (that is, when running the programme code).

For example, we might need to, based on some condition, perform one of multiple options, or to repeat some section of code.
A condition or _predicate_ is a `TRUE`/`FALSE` value, such as

  * whether a bank account balance is below zero
  * whether a temperature has reached a certain threshold
  * whether there are a certain proportion of valid observation in a sample
  * whether there is network connectivity
  
anything that can be reduced to a `TRUE`/`FALSE` YES/NO type answer.

## `if` and `if ... else` statements

`if` statements are used to perform one of one or two options based on the value of a condition.

The syntax in R is similar to the syntax used in languages such as Java, JavaScript, C and C++.

An `if` conditional structure in R contains at least one `if` clause, followed by zero or more `else` clauses.

Note that there is no `elif` or `elsif` statement in R, as there is in some other languages.
Instead, `else` and `if` are just used together to achieve the same effect.

The `if` conditional statement in R looks like this:

```
if (condition) {
  # some code
}
```

and executes as follows:

  * evaluate `condition`
  * if `condition` is `TRUE` then execute the body of the `if` here shown as `# some code`
    * the body may be zero, one or more lines of code including other conditions and calls to functions
  * if `condition` is `FALSE` then do nothing: skip the body of the `if` statement 

```{r conditionals-example-1, exercise=TRUE}
x <- 5

if (x > 0) {
   print("x is a positive number")
}
```

The `if ... else` conditional statement looks like this:

```
if (condition) {
  # do this if condition is true
} else {
  # do this if condition is false
}
```

and executes as follows:

  * evaluate `condition`
  * if `condition` is `TRUE` then execute the body of the `if` here shown as `# do this if condition is true`
    * the body may be zero, one or more lines of code including other conditions and calls to functions
    * the second part of the `if`, the `else` clause shown above as `# do this if condition is false` is not executed
  * if `condition` is `FALSE` then execute the body of the `if` shown above as `# do this if condition is false`
    * the body may be zero, one or more lines of code including other conditions and calls to functions
    * the first part of the `if`, the clause here shown as `# do this if condition is true` is not executed

```{r conditionals-example-2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="conditionals-examples-set-up"}
x <- 5

if (x <= 0) {
   print("x is zero or a negative number")
} else {
   print("x is a positive number")
}
```

Sometimes it is necessary to chain multiple decisions one after the other.
For convenience instead of nesting `else` clauses ever deeper and deeper
chained `if ... else if ... else if ... else` statements look like this:

```
if (condition_1) {
  # action 1
} else if (condition_2) {
  # action 2
} else if (condition_3) {
  # action 3
} ... and so on ... {
} else {
  # fall-through action
}
```

and executes as follows:

  * evaluate `condition1`
  * if `condition1` is `TRUE` then execute the following body shown above as `# action 1`
    * the body may be zero, one or more lines of code including other conditions and calls to functions
    * none of the other bodies are executed
    * no more evaluation is done of the other conditions
  * if `condition1` is `FALSE` then `condition_2` is executed
  * if `condition2` is `TRUE` then execute the following body code shown above as `# action 2`
    * the body may be zero, one or more lines of code including other conditions and calls to functions
    * none of the other bodies are executed
    * no more evaluation is done of the other conditions
  * and so on for `condition_3` and `# action 3` and 4 and 5 and however many there are
  * finally, only if all the previous conditions are `FALSE` execute the `# fall-through action` block of code
    * the block may be zero, one or more lines of code including other conditions and calls to functions
    * none of the other bodies are executed
    
```{r conditionals-example-3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="conditionals-examples-set-up"}
x <- 5

if (x > 0) {
   print("x is a positive number")
} else if (x == 0) {
   print("x is zero")
} else if (x < 0) {
   print("x is a negative number")
} else {
    print(paste("x is something else:", x))
}
```
    
It's important to note that only one of the blocks is ever executed.
If there is no catch all final `else` clause it's possible for no blocks to be executed.

So, for example in the following code

```
x <- 5

if (x < 10) {
  print("Hello")
} else if (x < 15) {
  print("Goodbye")
}
```

even though both conditions would evaluate to `TRUE`,
because execution stops after the first condition which evaluates to `TRUE`
the second is never evaluated.
The output from this block of code would be `Hello`.
Try it

```{r conditionals-at-most-one-block, exercise=TRUE}
x <- 5

if (x < 10) {
  print("Hello")
} else if (x < 15) {
  print("Goodbye")
}
```

Let's test all of this with several different values of `x` by defining a function (we don't want to repeat code).

```
test_x <- function(x) {
  if (x > 0) {
     print("x is a positive number")
  } else if (x == 0) {
     print("x is zero")
  } else if (x < 0) {
     print("x is a negative number")
  } else {
      print(paste("x is something else:", x))
  }
}
```

```{r conditionals-example-4-setup}
test_x <- function(x) {
  if (x > 0) {
     print("x is a positive number")
  } else if (x == 0) {
     print("x is zero")
  } else if (x < 0) {
     print("x is a negative number")
  } else {
      print(paste("x is something else:", x))
  }
}
```

```{r conditionals-example-4, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="conditionals-example-4-setup"}
test_x(3)
```

```{r conditionals-example-5, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="conditionals-example-4-setup"}
test_x(0)
```

```{r conditionals-example-5a, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="conditionals-example-4-setup"}
test_x(-20)
```

```{r conditionals-example-6, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="conditionals-example-4-setup"}
test_x(NA) # set x to missing
```

Notice that the last example gives an error due to `x` containing the special value `NA`.
This is because comparing things to `NA` gives `NA` not a boolean `TRUE`/`FALSE` value.

Let's rewrite our conditional statement to deal with it and some other special non-numeric values.
Note the use of the `|` symbol to denote 'logical OR' in the first conditional statement:

```{r conditionals-example-7, exercise=TRUE}
x <- NA

if (is.na(x) | is.nan(x)) {
    print(paste("x is something else:", x))
} else if (x > 0) {
   print("x is a positive number")
} else if (x == 0) {
   print("x is zero")
} else if (x < 0) {
   print("x is a negative number")
}
```

Note that curly braces are not needed if there is only one statement in each of the conditional blocks.
Thus, this is equivalent to the code above **but is highly discouraged because it makes code less readable**:

```{r conditionals-example-8, exercise=TRUE}
x <- -3

if (x > 0) print("x is a positive number") else print("x is zero or a negative number")
```

Best practice is to **always** include `{ }` around code blocks to make things more readable and avoid errors.

`if` only tests the first value in a vector,
but it prints a helpful warning message if there is more than one value in a vector involved in such a comparison:

```{r conditionals-example-9, exercise=TRUE}
x <- c(2, -3, 67, 0)

if (x > 0) {
  print("x is a positive number")
} else {
  print("x is zero or a negative number")
}
```

## `ifelse()`

The `condition` in an `if` statement only checks the first value of a vector.
There is a vectorised function, `ifelse(test, yes, no)` of three arguments which can be use when more than one value is under consideration.
`ifelse` returns a value with the same shape as `test`
which is filled with elements selected from either `yes` or `no`
depending on whether the corresponding element of `test` is `TRUE` or `FALSE`.
The vectors `yes` and `no` are recycled if they are too short.

```{r conditionals-example-10, exercise=TRUE}
x <- c(2, -3, 67, 0)

ifelse(x > 0, "x is a positive number", "x is zero or a negative number")
```

## Activity: `if` and `ifelse()`

Write some R code to:

  * create an integer vector containing a single value
  * test whether that integer is odd or even and print out 'odd' or 'even' accordingly.
    * hint: use the modulus operator `%%` which gives the remainder after integer division, _e.g._ `10 %% 3` evaluates to `1`.

```{r conditionals-exercise-1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 3}


```

```{r conditionals-exercise-1-solution}
a <- 45L

if (a %% 2 == 0) print("even") else print("odd")
```

Write some R code to:

  * create an integer vector containing multiple odd and even values
  * return a vector which contains ${x_i}^2$ if $x_i$ is odd and $\frac{x_i}{2}$ if $x_i$ is even.

```{r conditionals-exercise-2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 3}


```

```{r conditionals-exercise-2-solution}
a <- c(1L, 2L, 3L, 4L, 5L)

ifelse(a %% 2 == 1, a ^ 2, a / 2)
```

## `switch()`

R provides a `switch()` function, which is similar to `switch`...`case` constructs in other programming languages.

The `switch()` function look like this:

```
switch(expression, ...)
```

and executes as follows:

  * evaluate `expression`
  * if `expression` does not evaluate to a character string it is coerced to integer
    * if the integer is between 1 and the `nargs-1` (where `nargs`) is the number of arguments supplied to `switch()` the corresponding element of `...` is evaluated and the result returned
  * if `expression` evaluated to a character string then the names of the elements in `...` are checked
    * if there is an argument with a matching name it is evaluated and returned
    * if there is a matching but the return value is missing the next non-missing element is evaluated and returned
    * if there is no match and there is an _unnamed_ element of `...` it is evaluated and returned (it is an error to have more than one)
  * if there is no match `NULL` is returned
  
Consider:

```{r loops-example-5, exercise=TRUE}
# the second item in the list of arguments is returned
switch(2, "red", "green", "blue")
```

```{r loops-example-6, exercise=TRUE}
# the first item in the list of arguments is returned
switch(1, "red", "green", "blue")
```

And with named arguments:

```{r loops-example-7, exercise=TRUE}
switch("shape", "color" = "red", "shape" = "square", "length" = 5)

switch("length", "color" = "red", "shape" = "square", "length" = 5)

switch("b", "a" = "red", "b" = , "c" = 5)

switch("missing", "a" = "red", "b" = , "c" = 5, "hello")
```


## `while` loops

Loops are used to perform repetition in a program.

The `while` conditional statement in R looks like this:

```
while (condition) {
  # some code
}
```

and executes as follows:

  * evaluate `condition`
  * if `condition` is `TRUE` then execute the body of the `while` shown above as `# some code`
    * the body may be zero, one or more lines of code including other conditions and calls to functions
  * upon reaching the end of the block return to the top to evaluate the condition again
  * a `while` loop executes _zero or more_ times (the condition may be `FALSE` the first time)

In a `while` loop, the condition is checked each time just before the `while()` block is about to be run,
to determine if it should be run again.
We can change things insides the `while` body to control whether the condition evaluates to `TRUE` or `FALSE` next time around.
It's possible to write loops that loop forever if the condition is not changed correctly.
It's important to note that `condition` is tested and execution of the loop skipped _only_ at the top of the loop.
If the `condition` changes partway through the block, execution still continues to the end of the block.
Execution does not suddenly stop magically partway through.

Consider the following loop.

```
i <- 1
while (i <= 10) {
   print(i)
   i <- i + 1
}
print("done")
```

In this code, the loop will keep running,
until the value of the variable `i` is increased to 11, after having printed 10 on the screen.

When `i` reaches the value of 11,
this the condition `i <= 10` (i is less than or equal to 10) is `FALSE`,
the test at the top of the loop fails and execution skips the body and passes on to the code after the loop.

Try it.

```{r loops-example-1, exercise=TRUE}
i <- 1
while(i <= 10) {
   print(i)
   i <- i + 1
}
print("done")
```

`while` loops are good for when we know that we want to keep doing something and we know when we want to stop
but we may not know exactly how many times we will want to loop.

## `for` loops

R also supports iteration (looping) over each value in a vector or list or other sequence.

The `for` loop in R looks like this:

```
for (variable in sequence) {
  # some code
}
```

and executes as follows:

  * for each value of sequence in order
    * set `variable` to $sequence_i$
    * execute the body of the `for` shown above as `# some code` with `variable` set to that value
  * a `for` loop executes the same number of times as the length of `sequence`

Consider this R code:

```{r loops-example-2, exercise=TRUE}
a <- c(1,2,3,4,5)

for (i in a) {
    print(i^2)
}
```

This code will print in turn `1`, `4`, `9`, `16`, `25` and `i` is set to `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5` in turn.

A `for` loop is useful when we want to iterate over the values in a vector or list.

It should should be noted that in R this is less often than in other languages because most functions in R already work with vectors.
For example, in other languages, to calculated the squares of all numbers in an sequence it is necessary to loop over that sequence.
In R we can just write `result <- v ^ 2` because `^` works with vectors and already handles multiple values for us.
This is one of the strengths of R and leads to concise and clear code.

The `for` loop has a very definite place in R, but if you find yourself thinking about looping over all the elements of a vector
(especially if you're coming from another language where this approach is common like C or Python)
ask yourself if there is a vectorised function and more R-like approach already available.

## `repeat` loops

Looping (iteration) can also be performed with the `repeat` statement.

A `repeat` loop does not use any condition check or index to control the looping.
A `repeat` loop will forever, until (or unless) the loop is explicitly terminated
(which we haven't seen how to do yet but we're about to).

A repeat loop looks like this in R:

```
repeat {
}
```

and is equivalent to

```
while (TRUE) {
}
```

Why might we want to do this?

Sometimes forcing a loop to fit the `while (condition) { ... }` model which has the test at the top leads to
convoluted and less readable code.

So how to exit a `repeat` loop?

## break

The `break` statement exits the innermost enclosing loop.
Control is transferred to the first statement outside the inner-most loop.

To see this in action look at the following code which loops, adding 1 to `x` each time,
until `x` equals 6, at which point `break` is called which causes control to exit the loop.

```{r loops-example-3, exercise=TRUE}
x <- 1

repeat {
    print(x)
    x = x + 1
    if (x == 6) {
      break
    }
}
```

`break` works with any sort of loop in R,
regardless of whether it is implemented by using `while`, `for` or `repeat`. 

```{r loops-example-break-2, exercise=TRUE}
for (i in 1:10) {
  if (i == 5) {
    break
  }
  print(i)
}

a <- 1
while (a <= 10) {
  print(a)
  a <- a + 1
  if (a == 5) {
    break
  }
}
```

Both `break` and `next` (see below) apply only to the innermost of nested loops.

## next

There is also a `next` statement that can be used in loops.

Both `break` and `next` apply only to the innermost of nested loops.

`next` works with any sort of loop in R,
regardless of whether it is implemented by using `while`, `for` or `repeat`. 

A `next` statement halts the processing of the current iteration and advances to the next iteration.
When used in a `for` loop it advances to the next value in the sequence.
When used in a `while` loop it returns to the top of the loop and re-evaluates the `condition` before continuing.
When used in a `repeat` loop it starts the next iteration by returning to the top of the block of code.

```{r loops-example-next-2, exercise=TRUE}
for (i in 1:10) {
  if (i == 5) {
    next
  }
  print(i)
}

a <- 0
while (a < 10) {
  a <- a + 1
  if (a == 5) {
    next
  }
  print(a)
}
```

Notice how the `while` loop here is quite different to the previous examples.
One must be careful using `next`.
**If next is called before the loop condition is modified then the loop will never terminate**
because `condition` will be exactly the same the next time around.

## Activity: loops

Remember our `five_powers` function from section 5?

```
five_powers <- function(x) {
    # create a list with 5 empty elements in it
    result <- list(5)
    result[[1]] <- x
    result[[2]] <- x^2
    result[[3]] <- x^3
    result[[4]] <- x^4
    result[[5]] <- x^5
    return(result)
}
```

Rewrite this function using an appropriate loop, and test it by calling the function you write.

```{r loops-exercise-1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=8}


```

```{r loops-exercise-1-hint-1}
five_powers <- function(x) {
    # create a list with 5 empty elements in it
    result <- list(5)
    
    # replace this comment with your code
    
    return(result)
}
five_powers(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))
```

```{r loops-exercise-1-hint-2}
five_powers <- function(x) {
    # create a list with 5 empty elements in it
    result <- list(5)
    for (i in 1:5) {
      result[[i]] = x^i
    }
    return(result)
}
five_powers(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))
```

## Summary

That concludes section 6 and the Introduction to R tutorial.
