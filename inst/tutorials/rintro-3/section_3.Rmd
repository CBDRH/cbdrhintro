## Overview

This tutorial is broken into six sections.

In sections 1 and 2 we looked at some of the basics types and operators R provides.
We also looked at the vector, a very important basic R data type.

This section deals with some less common data types used in R:

 * Matrices
 * Matrix arithmetic
 * Lists

This section may be done after section 4 the first time through this tutorial if desired.

## Matrices in R

Matrices (matrixes) in R are similar to vectors in that they can contain elements of only one data type.
Unlike vectors they have two dimensions, not just one.

In fact, a matrix in R is actually just a vector onto which an additional dimension has been imposed.
This can be seen from the way matrices are created using the `matrix()` function.

Arrays in R are similar to matrices, but they have more than two dimensions.

The distinction is made between matrices and arrays because two-dimensional matrices are the foundation of linear algebra,
which is extensively used in statistics and statistical computation.
R provides a rich variety of functions that efficiently implement linear algebra operations, that only work on objects of the 'matrix' class.

To create a matrix in R, you can use the `matrix()` function thus:

```{r matrices-exercise-1, exercise=TRUE}
a <- matrix(c(2, 4, 3, 1, 5, 7), # the data elements 
            nrow=2,              # number of rows 
            ncol=3)              # number of columns 

a
class(a)
```

Notice that the matrix is filled column-wise:
the first two values are used to fill the first column, the next two values are used to fill the second column, and so on.

Matrices can be created row-wise by using the `byrow` argument to the `matrix()` function:

```{r matrices-exercise-2, exercise=TRUE}
b <- matrix(c(2, 4, 3, 1, 5, 7), # the data elements 
            nrow=2,              # number of rows 
            ncol=3,              # number of columns 
            byrow=TRUE)          # fill the matrix row-wise

b
```

Note that each row and column in a matrix (and higher dimensions in an array) can be given a name.
If a source data vector is provided it is not necessary to specify both the number of rows and the number of columns
since one can be inferred from the other (because the length of the source vector gives the total number of cells in the matrix or array):

```{r matrices-exercise-3, exercise=TRUE}
c <- matrix(c(2, 4, 3, 1, 5, 7), 
            nrow = 2,
            dimnames = list(
                c("row one", "row two"),
                c("col one", "col two", "col three")
            ))

c
```

```{r matrices-exercises-set-up-d}
c <- matrix(c(2, 4, 3, 1, 5, 7), 
            nrow = 2,
            dimnames = list(
                c("row one", "row two"),
                c("col one", "col two", "col three")
            ))
```

You can also use the `rownames()` and `colnames()` functions to get or set the row and column names of a matrix object:

```{r matrices-exercise-4, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="matrices-exercises-set-up-d"}
rownames(c)
colnames(c)
```

The `dim()` function will return the dimensions of the matrix.
It can also be used to set, or impose matrix dimensions on a vector (by specifying the number of rows then columns):

```{r matrices-exercise-5, exercise=TRUE}
# create b as a vector
b <- c(2, 4, 3, 1, 5, 7)
dim(b)
# turn the vector into a matrix
dim(b) <- c(2, 3)
dim(b)

b

class(b)
```

Note that the `dim()` function can also be used to reshape an existing matrix.
When using `dim()` to do this any row and column names are lost:

```{r matrices-exercises-set-up-a}
a <- matrix(c(2, 4, 3, 1, 5, 7), # the data elements 
            nrow=2,              # number of rows 
            ncol=3)              # number of columns 
```

```{r matrices-exercises-set-up-c}
c <- matrix(c(2, 4, 3, 1, 5, 7), 
            nrow = 2,
            dimnames = list(
                c("row one", "row two"),
                c("col one", "col two", "col three")
            ))
```

```{r matrices-exercise-6, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="matrices-exercises-set-up-a"}
dim(a)
a

dim(a) <- c(3,2)
a
```

The `length()` function, which returns the number of elements in a vector, also works with matrices and arrays,
where it returns the product of all the dimensions, that is, the total number of data elements (cells) in the matrix or array:

```{r matrices-exercise-7, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="matrices-exercises-set-up-a"}
a
length(a)
```

Elements of a matrix can be accessed, and their values set, using `[]` square bracket operators, just like vectors,
but with two dimensions of indices, separated by a comma.

Rows come first, then columns:

```{r matrices-exercise-8a, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="matrices-exercises-set-up-a"}
a
a[1, 1]
a[2, 3]
```


If you want, say, all the rows in a matrix but only some columns, just leave the rows parameter to the `[ ]` operator blank:

```{r matrices-exercise-9, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="matrices-exercises-set-up-a"}
# matrix a looks like this
a

# all rows but only column 2 of matrix a
a[,2]

# all columns but only row 2 of matrix a
a[2,]
```

Notice that the result is no longer a matrix, it's a vector, because there is only one column or one row returned.

```{r matrices-exercise-10, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="matrices-exercises-set-up-a"}
class(a[,2])
class(a[2,])
```

The comma `,` is important when addressing a matrix.
Because a matrix is a vector under the hood not using a `,` means selecting the nth element of the matrix running down the columns in turn.

```{r matrices-exercise-10a, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="matrices-exercises-set-up-a"}
a
a[1]
a[2]
a[3]
```

Let's reshape matrix `a` and try subsetting again, but requesting two columns:

```{r matrices-exercise-11, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="matrices-exercises-set-up-a"}
dim(a) <- c(2,3)
a

# all rows but only columns 1 and 3 of matrix a
a[,c(1,3)]

# notice that the result is now still a matrix, because there is more than one column and more than one row
class(a[,c(1,3)])
```

Negative indices can also be used with matrices and arrays.
This has the same effect as when subsetting a vector, the given rows/columns are excluded.
It also has the same restriction: positive and negative indices may not be mixed.

```{r matrices-exercise-12, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="matrices-exercises-set-up-a"}
a[,-2]
```

Subsetting matrices and arrays by element name also works as expected:

```{r matrices-exercise-13, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="matrices-exercises-set-up-c"}
c

c["row two", "col three"]
```

Assignment to elements in a matrix or array is analogous to assignment to elements of a vector:

```{r matrices-exercise-14, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="matrices-exercises-set-up-c"}
c[2, 2] <- NA

c
```

Matrices can be combined, row-wise or column-wise, using the `rbind()` and `cbind()` functions:

```{r matrices-exercise-15, exercise=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
a <- matrix(c(2, 4, 3, 1, 5, 7), # the data elements 
            nrow=2,              # number of rows 
            ncol=3)              # number of columns 

b <- matrix(c(12, 14, 13, 11, 15, 17),  # the data elements 
            nrow=2,                     # number of rows 
            ncol=3)                     # number of columns 
a
b
```

```{r matrices-exercise-binding-set-up}
a <- matrix(c(2, 4, 3, 1, 5, 7), # the data elements 
            nrow=2,              # number of rows 
            ncol=3)              # number of columns 
b <- matrix(c(12, 14, 13, 11, 15, 17),   # the data elements 
            nrow=2,              # number of rows 
            ncol=3)              # number of columns 
```

```{r matrices-exercise-17, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="matrices-exercise-binding-set-up"}
# join rows together
rbind(a, b)
```

```{r matrices-exercise-18, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="matrices-exercise-binding-set-up"}
# join columns together
cbind(a, b)
```

## Visualising matrices

Matrices can readily be visualised in R using the `image()` function.
First, let's create a matrix consisting of just ones and zeros, drawing the shape of a T with the zeros:

```{r visualising-matrices-set-up}
mat <- matrix(c(0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1), nrow=3, byrow=TRUE)
```

```{r visualising-matrices-exercise-1, exercise=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
mat <- matrix(c(0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1), nrow=3, byrow=TRUE)

mat
```

Now let's visualise that using `image()`.
The `image()` function chooses colours for us automatically (although the colours can be overridden, of course).

```{r visualising-matrices-exercise-2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="visualising-matrices-set-up"}
image(mat)
```

Well, it draws a T, but rotated through 90 degrees.
For some obscure reason, the `image()` function draws matrices in a rotated fashion.
Never mind, we can just define a function to rotate our matrix before visualising it
(we can define our own functions in R as we will see later in section 5):

```{r visualising-matrices-exercise-3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="visualising-matrices-set-up"}
rotate <- function(x) t(apply(x, 2, rev))
    
image(rotate(mat))
```

Here we see a visualisation of a matrix called `volcano` (this matrix is built-in to R as an example),
the cells of which contain the heights of a volcano at grid references:

```{r visualising-matrices-exercise-4, exercise=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
class(volcano)
head(volcano)
```

Note that the `head()` functions shows us the first 6 rows of an object (`tail()` shows the last 6 rows).
Because there are more columns than will fit across the screen, the output ends up wrapped onto multiple lines.
Helpfully, R repeats the row and column indices each time the output is wrapped.

Let's visualise it:

```{r visualising-matrices-exercise-5, exercise=TRUE}
image(volcano)
```

...or to put that in perspective, using the `persp()` function:

```{r visualising-matrices-exercise-6, exercise=TRUE}
persp(volcano)
```

## Matrix arithmetic

The standard arithmetic operators, `+`, `-`, `*` and `/`, all work element-wise on matrices, just as they do with vectors.

The operators `+` and `-` are probably what are wanted when adding and subtracting matrices because
they add and subtract the elements of the matrices element-wise.

Note that when performing this type of arithmetic on two matrices, they must be 'conformable',
_i.e._ the matrices must each be exactly the same size and shape, or you won't get the results you expect.

But **`*` is not matrix multiplication** but element-wise multiplication of individual entries and that's
not what is conventionally meant when writing an expression like `A * B` when `A` and `B` are matrices.
This can be a source of error and confusion.

Recall that we have defined two matrices, `a` and `b`:

```{r matrix-arithmetic-exercise-1, exercise=FALSE, echo=TRUE, exercise.setup="matrices-exercise-binding-set-up"}
a

b
```

Now write R code to print the sum of `a` and `b`:

```{r matrix-arithmetic-exercise-2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="matrices-exercise-binding-set-up"}

```

```{r matrix-arithmetic-exercise-2-hint}
a + b
```

Now write R code to print the difference of `a` and `b` (`a` minus `b`):

```{r matrix-arithmetic-exercise-3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="matrices-exercise-binding-set-up"}

```

### Scalar multiplication

Note that because these operations are element-wise the basic multiplication (`*`), division (`/`)
and exponentiation (`^` and `**`) operators are **not** matrix operations.

The expression `a * b` multiplies the elements of `a` and `b` element-wise and does **not** perform matrix multiplication.

$$\left(\matrix{24 & 39 & 75 \\ 56 & 11 & 119}\right) \leftarrow \left(\matrix{2 & 3 & 5 \\ 4 & 1 & 7}\right) * \left(\matrix{12 & 13 & 15 \\ 14 & 11 & 17}\right)$$

```{r matrix-arithmetic-exercise-4, exercise=FALSE, echo=TRUE, exercise.setup="matrices-exercise-binding-set-up"}
a
b
a * b
```

This means that these operations are usually only useful with singleton vectors to effect scalar multiplication and division, &c.

$$\left(\matrix{6 & 9 & 15 \\ 12 & 3 & 21}\right) \leftarrow \left(\matrix{2 & 3 & 5 \\ 4 & 1 & 7}\right) * 3$$

$$\left(\matrix{0.6666667 & 1.0000000 & 1.666667 \\ 1.3333333 & 0.3333333 & 2.333333}\right) \leftarrow \left(\matrix{2 & 3 & 5 \\ 4 & 1 & 7}\right) / \; 3$$

$$\left(\matrix{4 & 9 & 25 \\ 16 & 1 & 49}\right) \leftarrow \left(\matrix{2 & 3 & 5 \\ 4 & 1 & 7}\right) \wedge 2$$

So vector recycling means that arithmetic involving a matrix and a single vector works as expected.

```{r matrix-arithmetic-exercise-6, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="matrices-exercise-binding-set-up"}
# remind ourselves what is in matrix a
a

# multiply a by 2
a * 3

# divide a by 3
a / 3

# square each element of a
a ^ 2
```

Recycling does however mean that arithmetic involving a matrix and a vector with more than one element may not work as expected.
When the two matrices are not conformable, _i.e._ not the same size and shape, the result may be very much not what is expected.

```{r matrix-arithmetic-exercise-6a, exercise=FALSE, echo=TRUE, exercise.setup="matrices-exercise-binding-set-up"}
a * c(1, 2, 3)
```

Remember that a matrix is stored columm-wise going down the rows so this is what is happening.

$$\left(\matrix{2 & 9 & 10 \\ 8 & 1 & 21}\right) \leftarrow \left(\matrix{2 \times 1 & 3 \times 3 & 5 \times 2 \\ 4 \times 2 & 1 \times 1 & 7 \times 3}\right) \leftarrow  \left(\matrix{2 & 3 & 5 \\ 4 & 1 & 7}\right) * \left(\matrix{1 & 2 & 3}\right)$$

Which is usually not what was intended.

### Matrix multiplication

Matrix arithmetic (in the mathematical sense) is performed using the special operators `%*%` for inner matrix multiplication,
and `%o%` for outer matrix multiplication (or the `inner()` and `outer()` functions, which are equivalent).

For matrix multiplication, the number of rows in the first matrix must be the same as the number of columns in the second matrix.

Matrix inversion is performed using the `solve()` function, and matrix transposition using `t()`:

```{r matrix-arithmetic-exercise-7, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="matrices-exercise-binding-set-up"}
a

t(a)
```

### Logical operations on matrices

Comparisons and logical operations also work with matrices, just as they do with vectors:

```{r matrix-arithmetic-exercise-8, exercise=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
d <- matrix(9:17, nrow=3)
d
```

```{r matrix-arithmetic-exercise-8-set-up}
d <- matrix(9:17, nrow=3)
```

```{r matrix-arithmetic-exercise-9, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="matrix-arithmetic-exercise-8-set-up"}
# a logical matrix created with a conditional expression
d > 12
```

```{r matrix-arithmetic-exercise-10, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="matrix-arithmetic-exercise-8-set-up"}
# replace all values in d which are greater than 12 with NA
d[d > 12] <- NA
d
```

Matrices have their uses but they have the same restriction as vectors in that all elements have to be of the same type.
This usually limits their use to purely mathematical applications.
For managing and manipulating tabular data we will be looking at another data type, the _data frame_.

## Lists

So far we have covered vectors, matrices (and mentioned arrays).
These data structures are very useful, but they all have one limitation: they can only handle one data type.
You cannot, for example, store a mixture of, say, character strings and floating-point (real) numbers in a single vector or matrix.

The list data structure in R addresses this issue.
It permits objects of different data types or classes to be stored in a single list object, and referenced by index position or name.

Let's create several vectors, each of a different data type, and a matrix, and add them all to a list object using the `list()` function:

```{r lists-exercises-set-up}
i <- c(2L, 3L, 5L)
n <- c(3.56, 2.9736435, 19.8)
c <- c("aa", "bb", "cc", "dd", "ee") 
b <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE) 
m <- matrix(c(2, 4, 3, 1, 5, 7), nrow=3)
x <- list(i, n, c, b, m)  
```

```{r lists-exercise-1, exercise=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
i <- c(2L, 3L, 5L)
n <- c(3.56, 2.9736435, 19.8)
c <- c("aa", "bb", "cc", "dd", "ee") 
b <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE) 
m <- matrix(c(2, 4, 3, 1, 5, 7), nrow=3)

# add them all to a list 
x <- list(i, n, c, b, m)  

x
```

Notice that the list object `x` contains 5 elements, with the index for (position of) each element shown in double square brackets `[[ ]]`.

Each element in the list is itself an object, each one of a different data type or class.
We can use single square brackets to subset the elements of a list.

Note that this returns a list:

```{r lists-exercise-2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="lists-exercises-set-up"}
x[3]
class(x[3])
```

If we wish to access the objects contained in a list directly, the double square bracket operator is used.
The following returns the 3rd element of the list `x` by itself,
rather than returning a list containing the 3rd element as the single square bracket operator would do:

```{r lists-exercise-3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="lists-exercises-set-up"}
x[[3]]
class(x[[3]])
```

One can also insert or even modify elements of a list directly (in place) in the list that contains them,
using the `[[ ]]` operator and the `[ ]` operator.
Here we are updating the second value of a vector which is contained in the third element of the list x:

```{r lists-exercise-4, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="lists-exercises-set-up"}
x[[3]] # before

x[[3]][2] <- "BB"

x[[3]] # after
```

Elements in a list may also be named and referenced by name.
Let's reconstruct the list `x`, this time assigning names to each element. Note the syntax used:

```{r lists-exercise-5, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="lists-exercises-set-up"}
x <- list(integers=i, real_numbers=n, character_strings=c, logicals=b, "The Matrix"=m) 

x
```

Notice that named list elements are printed with a $ prefix, and the $ operator can also be used to access them:

```{r lists-exercise-6, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="lists-exercise-6-set-up"}
x$character_strings

x$logicals

x$"The Matrix"
```

```{r lists-exercise-6-set-up}
i <- c(2L, 3L, 5L)
n <- c(3.56, 2.9736435, 19.8)
c <- c("aa", "bb", "cc", "dd", "ee") 
b <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE) 
m <- matrix(c(2, 4, 3, 1, 5, 7), nrow=3)
x <- list(integers=i, real_numbers=n, character_strings=c, logicals=b, "The Matrix"=m) 
```

The single square brackets and double square brackets operators also work for named list elements:

```{r lists-exercise-7, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="lists-exercise-6-set-up"}
x['real_numbers']
class(x['real_numbers'])
```

```{r lists-exercise-8, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="lists-exercise-6-set-up"}
x[['real_numbers']]
class(x[['real_numbers']])
```

### Activity: manipulating lists

Many R statistical functions return their results in the form of a named list.
We will use a built-in data set that comes with R, called `mtcars`, which contains data about motor cars,
and we will use the `lm()` function to fit a linear regression model to two variables in that data set
(we will see how fuel economy in miles per gallon is related to the weight of each car, in pounds: it is an American data set).
We will store the results of that regression in an object called `lm_results`, using this code:

```
lm_results <- lm(mpg ~ wt, mtcars)
```

<div class="aside">
### An aside...

We haven't discussed the `~` operator (and won't in this tutorial).
It is used to create a _formula_ object with the response on the left hand side and predictors on the right hand side.
Here we are saying '`mpg` depends on `wt`' and when used to create and fit a statistical model we would be estimating the parameters of

$$\textrm{mpg} = \alpha + \beta \, \textrm{wt} + \epsilon$$
</div>

`lm_results` is a list object.
Your task is to use the `names()` function to see the names of the elements it contains,
and then use double square brackets operator to extract three of the elements of `lm_results` and print out the contents of each element.

```{r lists-exercise-9, exercise=TRUE}
lm_results <- lm(mpg ~ wt, mtcars)

```

```{r lists-exercise-9-solution}
lm_results <- lm(mpg ~ wt, mtcars)

names(lm_results)

coeffs <- lm_results[["coefficients"]]
print(coeffs)

print('------------------------------') # just to visually separate the elements
    
residuals <- lm_results[["residuals"]]
print(residuals)

print('------------------------------') # just to visually separate the elements

terms <- lm_results[["terms"]]
print(terms)
```

## Summary

This concludes section 3 and our overview of matrices and lists.

In section 4 we will look at _data frames_.
